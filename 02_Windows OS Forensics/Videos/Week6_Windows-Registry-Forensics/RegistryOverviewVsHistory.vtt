00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.194
In this course, Course Six, we're going to
be discussing the Windows registry.

2
00:00:05.194 --> 00:00:09.010
An overview of this course,
we're going to understand the purpose and

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.040
structure of the files that
make up the Windows registry.

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.914
We're going to identify and

5
00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:20.440
extract important data from both
the live and the non live registry.

6
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.498
We're going to learn how to interpret and

7
00:00:22.498 --> 00:00:26.040
understand the data that we
find in the Windows registry.

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.420
We're going to learn to locate
the registry files within the computer's

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.340
operating system.

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.300
We're going to examine
the registry files and

11
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.590
locate data significant
to the investigation.

12
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.079
In our first module, we're going to talk
about the registry overview and history.

13
00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.601
Microsoft defines the Windows
registry as a hierarchical database

14
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:53.677
designed to store information that is
necessary to configure the system for

15
00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:58.540
one or more users, applications,
and hardware devices.

16
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.759
The Windows registry replaced
the old configuration and

17
00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:12.040
initialization ini files used in older
versions of Windows prior to Windows NT.

18
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.056
The registry, in my opinion,
is perhaps one of the most overlooked

19
00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:22.240
treasure trove of forensic
artifacts on a Windows system.

20
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.280
It is a great source of both evidence and
supporting evidence.

21
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.318
It's useful in validating our findings
throughout the investigation.

22
00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:36.900
Some of the artifacts that are contained
within the registry are user information,

23
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.695
information specific to each user
on the system, system information,

24
00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:44.461
and application specific information.

25
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.210
The registry also acts as a sort of
log file as it does track the system

26
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.740
changes and user created changes
are also often tracked in the registry.

27
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.256
The type of case that you're
investigating will determine

28
00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:06.151
the type of information
that you're looking for.

29
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:07.945
And this is true not only in the registry,

30
00:02:07.945 --> 00:02:10.061
but throughout the entire
Windows file system.

31
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.284
So if you're looking at a fraud or
harassment or child exploitation case,

32
00:02:15.284 --> 00:02:20.340
each of these cases, you'll be looking for
different types of information.

33
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.047
In our next module,
we're going to talk about the structure of

34
00:02:25.047 --> 00:02:29.861
the Windows registry and
what makes up the Windows registry.
