1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
In this course, we're talking
about the Windows Registry.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.790
In this module, module 2,

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.245
we're going to talk
about the structure

4
00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:08.925
of the Windows Registry.

5
00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:10.650
The layout of the Registry.

6
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.275
The Registry is
broken into hives,

7
00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:17.295
keys, sub-keys, values, and data.

8
00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:19.640
The data within the
Registry can be

9
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.035
stored in several
different formats.

10
00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:24.680
We can have binary data,

11
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.170
string data, text data,

12
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.055
and also BLOB data.

13
00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:32.495
BLOB stands for
binary large object.

14
00:00:32.495 --> 00:00:35.810
This slide shows us
what the live Registry

15
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.590
looks like if we open it
up in Registry Editor.

16
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.570
You can see at the top there,

17
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.455
we have the HKEY, the handle key.

18
00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:46.800
We have HKEY local machine.

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.770
Underneath that, we have

20
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.200
the hives and you can
see there the SAM,

21
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.795
security, software,
and system file,

22
00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.735
along with hardware
driver and components.

23
00:00:56.735 --> 00:01:00.940
Beneath that, we have our keys.

24
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.335
Those are sub-folders
of the hives.

25
00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:08.070
Beneath the keys,
we have sub-keys.

26
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.830
Over the right-hand pane,

27
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.780
you can see we have
values and we have data.

28
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.560
That is the basic structure
of the Windows Registry.

29
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.800
Now, the hive files that make up

30
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.135
the Registry can be divided
into two types of classes.

31
00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:28.625
They're either
system-related files

32
00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:30.620
or user-related files.

33
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.600
Now, the system-related files

34
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.265
are going to consist of the SAM,

35
00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:40.545
security, software, and
AmCache hive files.

36
00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:43.410
The user-related files
are going to be the NT

37
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.965
User.dat and the User Class.dat.

38
00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:52.945
Now, the system files will
dictate system-wide settings,

39
00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:55.610
and the user files
are going to be

40
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.910
specific to that individual user.

41
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.990
Every user on the system
will have their own NT

42
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.600
User.dat hive and
User Class.dat hive.

43
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.560
We are going to need

44
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.820
specialized tools to view
the Windows Registry files.

45
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.160
When your computer boots up,

46
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.895
the hive files get
pulled into memory.

47
00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:23.100
They are represented by
these HKs or handled keys.

48
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.835
We're going to have
HKEY local machine,

49
00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:32.565
HKEY classes root,
HKEY current config,

50
00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:36.510
HKEY users, and
HKEY current user.

51
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.765
We're talking about
live Registry.

52
00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:43.475
This is what it would look
like in Registry Editor.

53
00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:46.670
You can see we have classes root,

54
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.830
the handle key up at the top.

55
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.310
Now, certain handle keys are

56
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.495
only going to be found in
the live running Registry.

57
00:02:56.495 --> 00:02:59.480
These are keys like
HKEY current user,

58
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.585
hardware, and HKEY
current config.

59
00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:09.985
HKEY current user refers to
the currently logged-on user.

60
00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:14.820
That User NT.dat and User
Class.dat get pulled into

61
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.760
memory and they contain

62
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.050
all that user's specific
settings and activities.

63
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.700
Hardware is only going to be
found on the library system

64
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.635
and this covers Bios and
current hardware configuration.

65
00:03:30.635 --> 00:03:33.140
Hardware is going to have
information concerning

66
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.835
the Bios and the current
hardware configuration.

67
00:03:36.835 --> 00:03:40.049
Then we have HKEY current config.

68
00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.685
This is the current
system configuration

69
00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:46.345
relating mainly to software.

70
00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:50.240
Just be aware that on
a live running system,

71
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.270
the SAM hive file and all of

72
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.980
its sub-keys are not going
to be able to be accessed.

73
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.265
They are disabled.

74
00:04:00.265 --> 00:04:04.890
The security sub-key
is also disabled.

75
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.860
Looking at it through RegEditor,

76
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.655
we won't be able to see what
is contained in those hives.

77
00:04:11.655 --> 00:04:15.670
Now, some of our non-live
Registry files of interests.

78
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.815
We're going to take
a look at the SAM,

79
00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:22.110
system, security, software
and the AmCache file.

80
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.005
These are system-related files.

81
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:27.480
We're also going to
talk about the NT

82
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.600
User.dat and User Class.dat.

83
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.985
The non-line Registry, as
seen using Registry browser,

84
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.540
is what this slide depicts.

85
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.840
The Registry browser
does depict it pretty

86
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.495
much the same as RegEdit does.

87
00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:47.105
But with Registry browser,

88
00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:53.330
we can drill down into the
keys and see the data within.

89
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
It also helps us
translate some of

90
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.655
this data under the values,

91
00:04:59.655 --> 00:05:02.040
value data, and then
the bottom pane

92
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.730
data but it is laid out same way.

93
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.295
We have the handle
key at the top,

94
00:05:07.295 --> 00:05:08.950
we have the hives,

95
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.680
then we have the keys,

96
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.360
and then we have the sub-keys.

97
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.575
In our next module,

98
00:05:16.575 --> 00:05:18.780
we're going to talk
about the location of

99
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.375
the Registry files
within a forensic image.

100
00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:24.920
In this walk-through,
we are going to

101
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.285
locate and export the
Windows Registry files.

102
00:05:28.285 --> 00:05:29.690
The items we will need for

103
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.570
this Registry walk-through are

104
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.235
the Windows 10 vmdk
and FTK imager.

105
00:05:37.235 --> 00:05:40.579
Once you launch FTK imager,

106
00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:45.680
go ahead and load
the Windows 10 vmdk.

107
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.750
If you forgot how to do that,

108
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.800
it would be File,
Add evidence item.

109
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.270
We're looking for an image
file and you click "Next".

110
00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.215
Browse to where the image file
is saved on your computer.

111
00:06:00.215 --> 00:06:03.725
Simply click "Open" and
the file will load.

112
00:06:03.725 --> 00:06:06.560
Once it's loaded, go
ahead and expand it.

113
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.390
You'll see three partitions.

114
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.190
We're going to be
looking at partition

115
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.920
2 because that is where
the operating system is.

116
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.500
We expand partition 2 and we're
going to expand the NTFS.

117
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.145
We're going to expand root.

118
00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.720
Once we expand root,

119
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.889
we're going to go to
Windows and expand windows.

120
00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.620
We're going to scroll
down to system 32.

121
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.575
We're going to expand system 32.

122
00:06:30.575 --> 00:06:32.900
After we expand system 32,

123
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.315
we're going to locate
the config folder.

124
00:06:35.315 --> 00:06:36.890
We locate the config folder,

125
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.105
we're going to highlight it,

126
00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:40.295
and then we're going to
look in the file list pane.

127
00:06:40.295 --> 00:06:43.940
Here are all the files
inside the config folder.

128
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.640
We're looking for the SAM file,

129
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.790
security file, software file,

130
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.155
and the system file.

131
00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:53.195
Once we locate these files,

132
00:06:53.195 --> 00:06:54.410
we're going to go ahead and

133
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.305
right-click and we're
going to export the files.

134
00:06:57.305 --> 00:07:00.590
Choose a location on your
computer to export them to.

135
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.330
I'm going to choose
my desktop and make

136
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.485
a new folder and call
it Win 10 Registry.

137
00:07:05.485 --> 00:07:07.430
Then we'll go ahead and export

138
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.200
those files and it tells you

139
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.185
that it copy the
file successfully.

140
00:07:11.185 --> 00:07:13.110
Now, we're in Windows,

141
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.735
we're going to scroll back up.

142
00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:16.610
We'll close up some
of these folders

143
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.440
so we can navigate easier.

144
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.240
We'll close up system 32.

145
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.890
When we look at the
Windows folder.

146
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.360
Under the Windows folder,

147
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.650
we're going to expand
the folder app compact.

148
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.280
Underneath the Windows folder,

149
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.275
we're going to expand
the folder app compact.

150
00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:32.195
We're going to highlight
the program's folder

151
00:07:32.195 --> 00:07:33.665
underneath the app compact,

152
00:07:33.665 --> 00:07:35.480
and we see our AmCache hive.

153
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.670
We're going to go ahead and
select the AmCache hive,

154
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.770
right-click export files.

155
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.405
We're going to go
back to the folder

156
00:07:41.405 --> 00:07:43.415
on our desktop or
wherever you saved it,

157
00:07:43.415 --> 00:07:44.975
where you put your
Registry files.

158
00:07:44.975 --> 00:07:46.310
We're going to select that folder

159
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.790
Win 10 Registry and click "Okay".

160
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.420
Now, we're done in
the Windows folder,

161
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.800
so we'll go ahead
and close that up.

162
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.850
Now, we're going to expand the

163
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.680
Users folder and we're
going to click on

164
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.275
the Ivan user and we're
going to select the

165
00:07:57.275 --> 00:08:00.190
NT.dat file from
the file list pane.

166
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.000
We're going to right-click
Export Files and we'll choose

167
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.190
that same file Win 10
Registry and click "Okay",

168
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.155
then we're going to
select the Ivan user

169
00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.470
or whichever user you prefer,

170
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.080
but let's stay with
the Ivan user.

171
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.535
We're going to check app data.

172
00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:14.690
After we expand Ivan,

173
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.190
we're going to expand app data.

174
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.570
We're going to expand local.

175
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.860
After we expand local,

176
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.510
we're going to expand Microsoft.

177
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.505
We're going to scroll
down, expand Window.

178
00:08:22.505 --> 00:08:24.065
We're going to highlight
the Windows folder.

179
00:08:24.065 --> 00:08:26.420
Once you highlight the
Windows folder and again,

180
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.900
that's app data under
the user app data,

181
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.500
local, Microsoft highlight
the Windows folder.

182
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.970
We're going to look over in

183
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.545
the right-hand file list pane,

184
00:08:36.545 --> 00:08:38.545
and we see our User Class.dat.

185
00:08:38.545 --> 00:08:40.150
We're going to go ahead
and highlight the User

186
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.340
Class.dat, right-click
Export File.

187
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.805
We're going to choose our same
folder or Win 10 Registry.

188
00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:48.020
I'm going to click "Okay".

189
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.099
Now, we've exported
all our registry files

190
00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:54.875
from within the file
system in Windows.

191
00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:57.240
That is the end of
the walk-through.
