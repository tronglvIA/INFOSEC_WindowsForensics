00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.675
In this course we're talking
about the Windows Registry.

2
00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:06.960
In this module, we're going
to talk about the location

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.800
of the Registry files
within our forensic image.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.580
The file path to find are SAM,

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.875
security, software, and system,

6
00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:19.915
sometimes referred to as the 4Ss,

7
00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:23.275
is going to be from the root,

8
00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:25.155
the Windows directory,

9
00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:29.880
System32 and then we
highlight the config folder.

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.030
When we look to the right,

11
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.370
we can see our SAM,

12
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.170
security, software, and system

13
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.250
files listed in the files path.

14
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.250
We would be able to
export these files using

15
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.865
a tool such as FTK imager.

16
00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:51.145
Now, like I said,

17
00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:53.270
each user on the
system will have their

18
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.985
very own ntuser.dat file.

19
00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:59.840
You're going to find that
beneath the user's profile.

20
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.575
You would go to the root users,

21
00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:07.430
expand the user's folder and then

22
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.300
highlight the user that
you want to investigate.

23
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.355
Then, you look to the right
and in the file list page,

24
00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:20.005
you would see that
user's ntuser.dat file.

25
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:24.195
Using FTK imager, you
can export this file.

26
00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:28.210
We'll get to do that
in our walkthrough.

27
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.375
The UsrClass.dat file, again,

28
00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.070
is specific to each user.

29
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.245
Every user will
have one of these.

30
00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:40.040
You would again drill
down from root users,

31
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.280
locate the particular user
that you are interested in,

32
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.605
then you would have to go to

33
00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:50.400
app data and you expand app data.

34
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.875
You'd expand local,

35
00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:56.520
then you scroll down
and expand Microsoft.

36
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.280
Then you would highlight
the Windows folder.

37
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.195
Then you would look to the
right and the files pan.

38
00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:06.755
You can see that particularly
users UsrClass.dat file.

39
00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:10.385
Again, you can use FTK
imager to export the file.

40
00:02:10.385 --> 00:02:13.715
If you're exporting
multiple NT users

41
00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:16.655
or multiple UsrClass.dat files,

42
00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:18.770
I highly recommend that you name

43
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.475
them uniquely so that
you know which is which.

44
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:25.400
The AmCache hive
is a system file.

45
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.040
It's not part of the users like

46
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.115
the NT user or the UsrClass.dat,

47
00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:35.405
and it's going to be located
under the Windows directory.

48
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.725
So from the root,

49
00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:38.930
we will expand Windows,

50
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.210
and then we would
expand AppCompat,

51
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.805
and then we're going
to highlight programs.

52
00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:47.775
When you look to the right
when the file was pan,

53
00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:51.555
you would see the
Amcache.hve file,

54
00:02:51.555 --> 00:02:54.300
that is the AmCache hive file.

55
00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.045
Again, you can export this
using a tool like FTK imager.

56
00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:02.700
Now we're going to do our
registry walkthrough.

57
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.370
We're going to take
a look at our image

58
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.510
and we're going to find

59
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.990
these files and export
them using FTK imager.

60
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.565
So we're going to need

61
00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:15.820
our Windows 10 VMDK
and FTK imager.
