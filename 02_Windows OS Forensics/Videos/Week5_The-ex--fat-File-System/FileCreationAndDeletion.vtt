00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.640
We're talking about the exFat
File system in course 10.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.323
And in this module, module four, we're
going to talk about file creation and

3
00:00:09.323 --> 00:00:10.640
deletion.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.429
Well, when we create a file an exFAT,
what happens is the directory

5
00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.490
entry sets are created and we took
a look at those directory entry sets.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.751
In the last module, the bitmap entries for
the allocation clusters are set to one.

7
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.332
The FATs get updated if any of
the files are fragmented and

8
00:00:34.332 --> 00:00:41.150
data gets written into the clusters
that cluster, that data area.

9
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.990
When we delete a file, the directory
entry set flags get set to not in use.

10
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.429
And we did see that in
our last walk through.

11
00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:57.309
The Bitmap entries from the cluster
allocated to the file are set to 0.

12
00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.360
So the Bitmap entries get set to 0 and

13
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.570
then the clusters are marked
as available for use.

14
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.433
The FATs may or may not be zeroed out
depending the file directory data,

15
00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:16.710
the data that gets written out in
the cluster heat the actual data

16
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.300
in the file remains unchanged until
it is overwritten by a new file.

17
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.590
So that data stays there.

18
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.530
The point is to the data,
the Bitmap entries go away.

19
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.740
The directory flags get set to Not in Use.

20
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.113
The directories themselves
will not be overwritten unless

21
00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:43.061
a new filed directory enter
occupies that same space.

22
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.241
We're going to do a walkthrough.

23
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:47.899
We're going to create a file and
we're going to delete a file and we're

24
00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.810
going to take a look at Active Disk Editor
and see what happens when we do that.

25
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.287
The items were going to need for
this walkthrough as we're going to need

26
00:01:57.287 --> 00:02:02.161
Active Disk Editor are exFAT virtual
hard drive in Windows File Explorer.

27
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.940
Let's begin our walk through.

28
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.440
First thing we need to do if you're VHD
is not attached, you need to attach it.

29
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.432
You go to Actions, attach VHD navigate out

30
00:02:16.432 --> 00:02:20.323
to where you saved the exFAT VHD.

31
00:02:20.323 --> 00:02:24.213
You'd select it click Open and

32
00:02:24.213 --> 00:02:29.006
then click OK and your VHD will mount.

33
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:34.969
Once your VHD is mounted, make note of
the drive number and the drive letter,

34
00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:40.330
the volume letter from my and
his f yours will probably be different.

35
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.520
Now let's open Windows file Explorer and
navigate to the exFAT drive.

36
00:02:49.298 --> 00:02:54.012
We can see on there there should be two
files, one called long file name and

37
00:02:54.012 --> 00:02:55.851
one called short file name.

38
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.248
What we're going to do is we're going to

39
00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:07.624
create a file so
you can right click New and

40
00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:12.692
we're just going to do a text document and

41
00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:16.551
we can call this NewDoc_1.

42
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.561
So once you've created it,
let's open it up and put some data on it.

43
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.640
You can write what you would like.

44
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.668
I am just going to

45
00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:34.703
write this is a new

46
00:03:34.703 --> 00:03:40.076
text document that

47
00:03:40.076 --> 00:03:45.112
I have created and

48
00:03:45.112 --> 00:03:49.153
will delete.

49
00:03:49.153 --> 00:03:50.861
And once you've done that, just save it.

50
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.562
Close it and you can go ahead and

51
00:03:58.562 --> 00:04:02.940
minimize File Explorer.

52
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.961
Now we have Active Disk Editor open, we're
going to go ahead and select open disk.

53
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.500
We're going to navigate to volumes.

54
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.171
So across the top toolbar here
we're going to select volumes and

55
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:19.890
we're going to find our exFAT volume.

56
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.779
And we're going to double click
it when you select it and

57
00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:30.117
click Open and it opens to our
volume boot record in exFAT.

58
00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:34.961
Up here to get on the top toolbar,
we're going to select Browse File Records.

59
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.591
If you don't see your file
record there for your new file,

60
00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:46.751
go ahead and close and
reopen Active Disk Editor.

61
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.551
So close your exFAT volume.

62
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.661
Close Active Disk Editor and just go
ahead and relaunch Active Disk Editor.

63
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.240
Once you have relaunched Active Disk
Editor you should see the file NewDoc.txt.

64
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.003
And we're going to go ahead and
take a look at the file record for

65
00:05:18.003 --> 00:05:23.140
that file and
we see we have our file records.

66
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.740
Go ahead and set your template position.

67
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.472
We have the directory entry record below

68
00:05:30.472 --> 00:05:34.786
that we have our stream extension and

69
00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:39.518
below that we have our file name entry and

70
00:05:39.518 --> 00:05:43.851
we went over these in the last block.

71
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.631
So here's all our information
in our directory entry.

72
00:05:50.631 --> 00:05:55.602
We can see that is the entry
type is a hexidecimal

73
00:05:55.602 --> 00:06:00.461
85 which tells us that
is an allocated file.

74
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.830
We have a second count which tells us we
have two more directory entries besides

75
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.291
this one we're looking at.

76
00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:12.761
So we have two additional entries and
those are the stream and the file name.

77
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.451
We have our checks on for
air checking we have our file attributes

78
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:25.844
which if we go ahead on the left
hand side expand attributes,

79
00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:29.461
we can see that is an archive attribute.

80
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.240
Remember all these values
are read little indian.

81
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:40.238
We have our reserve bites and then we're
going to have our created date and time.

82
00:06:40.238 --> 00:06:43.440
Our modified date and time.

83
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.361
Our last access date and time.

84
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:53.876
Then we're going to have our created
10 millisecond refinement time.

85
00:06:53.876 --> 00:06:57.051
Our last modified 10
millisecond refinement time.

86
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.750
And we have our universal time code

87
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:11.361
are UTC offset created modified and
last accessed.

88
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.361
Moving down to our stream extension and
set our template position.

89
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.262
An extreme extension,

90
00:07:21.262 --> 00:07:26.351
we have our entry type which tells
us it is allocated because it is C0.

91
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.240
Then we have our secondary flags.

92
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.281
And if we go ahead and
expand that, that's a packed byte.

93
00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:38.275
So we're going to have
to look at the bits.

94
00:07:38.275 --> 00:07:43.696
And it's a three, so
allocation is turned on and

95
00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:46.746
now FAT chain is turned on.

96
00:07:46.746 --> 00:07:50.130
So we do not have a entry
in the FATs which

97
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.861
means this file is not fragmented and
it is allocated.

98
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.257
Then we have our name length,

99
00:08:02.257 --> 00:08:08.338
the number of characters in the file name.

100
00:08:08.338 --> 00:08:13.175
We have a name,
hash we have our valid data

101
00:08:13.175 --> 00:08:18.300
length which is are initialized file size.

102
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.861
Which is 63 bytes are reserved.

103
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:32.340
Our first cluster number which is
cluster 18 hexidecimal 1 2, decimal 18.

104
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.942
And we have again our file size which
is the actual size of the file and

105
00:08:37.942 --> 00:08:43.660
we can see it's 63 bytes in length
moving down or a file name entry.

106
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.558
Go ahead and
set your temple position again we have we

107
00:08:49.558 --> 00:08:54.386
can see our file type describes
as hexidecimal C1 and

108
00:08:54.386 --> 00:08:59.761
we know that it's allocated
by that it's in use reserved.

109
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.578
And then we have our file name.

110
00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:12.161
And we can see the file name and
ask it's off to the right NewText_1.txt.

111
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.844
So let's go ahead and
we're going to close this and

112
00:09:20.844 --> 00:09:26.761
we're going to go ahead and
close Active Disk Editor.

113
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.651
We're gonnna bring up our File Explorer.

114
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.773
Now we're going to select NewDoc_1.txt or

115
00:09:37.773 --> 00:09:42.461
whatever you named our new
document that we just created.

116
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.370
We're going to hold down our
shift key right click and

117
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.691
we're going to delete the file and Windows
is going to ask us if we're sure and

118
00:09:52.691 --> 00:09:57.810
we're going to say Yes and
we no longer see the file there.

119
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:04.061
Let's go ahead now and launch Active Disk
Editor now that we've deleted our file.

120
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:16.667
Once Active Disk Editor
open select Open Disk.

121
00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:20.861
We're going to select volumes because
we want to look at the exFAT volume.

122
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.966
We're going to select our exFAT volume and
click Open once our exFAT

123
00:10:27.966 --> 00:10:33.740
volume opens it's going to take
us to the volume boot record.

124
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.340
But we're going to go ahead and
open up Browse File Records and

125
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:45.640
we look in our file records, we no longer
see the document NewTextFile_1.txt.

126
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.580
So let's go ahead and
take a look at the root directory.

127
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.931
You can scroll down the root directory and

128
00:10:52.931 --> 00:10:57.285
locate some of the unallocated entries.

129
00:10:57.285 --> 00:11:02.718
And you can see them because we're
looking for this hexadecimal 05 and

130
00:11:02.718 --> 00:11:08.140
I locate the directory entry for
new text document down here.

131
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:13.490
Then we see the 05 entry with
an additional entries of two more entries.

132
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:18.277
And I see the 40 stream extension and
the 41 file name and

133
00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:24.332
we can see the file name and ask
the NewDoc_1.txt is what I name the file.

134
00:11:24.332 --> 00:11:26.243
Now an Active Disk Editor,

135
00:11:26.243 --> 00:11:30.640
if I set template position it
is not reading this correctly.

136
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:36.908
It reads the type and the secondary
entry count our check some are hash but

137
00:11:36.908 --> 00:11:42.764
now we have accustomed to find but
we know these are our file times and

138
00:11:42.764 --> 00:11:46.510
they're 4 by 32 bit MSDOS timestamps.

139
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.630
Red little indian should be
are created time modified.

140
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.915
Last access our millisecond time count for

141
00:11:54.915 --> 00:12:00.050
created our millisecond time count for
modified.

142
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:06.890
And then we have our UTC universal time
code offsets in the 15 minute increments.

143
00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.330
And we just have reserved
bites here at the end.

144
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:15.054
These are three UTC offsets for
created modified less access and

145
00:12:15.054 --> 00:12:18.940
the remainder of the bytes are unused.

146
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.370
Moving down to our stream
extension which is right here.

147
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.293
I'm going to go ahead and

148
00:12:24.293 --> 00:12:28.040
set template position anyway even though
it's not going to read it correctly.

149
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.964
It does tell me the type,
the entry type and

150
00:12:30.964 --> 00:12:35.240
we can see that is
an unallocated stream extension.

151
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:41.248
I do have my secondary flags here so
I'm able to open them up and

152
00:12:41.248 --> 00:12:44.731
I can see that it is not fragmented.

153
00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:49.595
I can see that I have my
name length name hash,

154
00:12:49.595 --> 00:12:55.108
we need to find the starting cluster for
this file.

155
00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:59.394
And so we'll find the offset to
the starting cluster which we know is 14.

156
00:12:59.394 --> 00:13:03.409
So we will go down one line and over 4 and

157
00:13:03.409 --> 00:13:07.182
this would be my starting cluster and

158
00:13:07.182 --> 00:13:12.427
again this is a 4 byte value,
read little indian.

159
00:13:12.427 --> 00:13:17.581
So when I looked down at my hexa
interpreter I can see my starting

160
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:24.306
cluster is still cluster 18 and then we
have our data length which is 63 bytes.

161
00:13:24.306 --> 00:13:27.741
So cluster 18,
let's see if the data is still there.

162
00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:31.362
So we're going to navigate out and
we have go to sector but

163
00:13:31.362 --> 00:13:33.840
we want to go to cluster 18.

164
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.215
So I'm going to type in 18 here,
we're going to say okay and

165
00:13:38.215 --> 00:13:40.160
we go out to cluster 18.

166
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.361
We can see that our data is still there.

167
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.740
This is a new text document that we
created and we're going to delete.

168
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.940
So here's our data out on the drive.

169
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.320
So even though I permanently deleted
this file, I use shift delete.

170
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.290
I didn't send it to the recycle bin.

171
00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:02.040
The data remains out on the drive and
its directory entry for

172
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.520
the most part remains intact.

173
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.492
So if we wanted to recover
this file we could and

174
00:14:07.492 --> 00:14:10.640
we're going to talk about
that in the next module.

175
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.530
I just wanted to show you how the data
changes when we delete a file.

176
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.430
What happens to our directory entries?

177
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.130
Also keep in mind that
when we delete a file,

178
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.032
not only do the directory entries change,
but

179
00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:32.140
the Bitmap entries for
the clusters are going to be set to 0.

180
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:37.054
And if this war fragmented file and
it did have a FAT table entry,

181
00:14:37.054 --> 00:14:39.335
the FATs would be zeroed out.

182
00:14:39.335 --> 00:14:44.344
That directory entry will
remain unchanged until we make

183
00:14:44.344 --> 00:14:49.471
a new file that occupies that
space in the root directory.

184
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:53.816
So that directory entry will be there
until it is overwritten by a new

185
00:14:53.816 --> 00:14:55.360
file directory entry.

186
00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.085
In our next module, we're going to
take a look at exFAT file recovery and

187
00:15:00.085 --> 00:15:02.961
how we would go about
recovering this file.
