00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
In this course, course 10,

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.670
we're covering the
exFAT file system.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.980
In this module, we're
going to talk about

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.875
the exFAT volume boot record.

5
00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:13.890
The exFAT volume boot
record is located

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.645
at physical sector
0 of the volume.

7
00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:22.275
It contains information
about the volume.

8
00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:24.480
The offsets you're
going to see in

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.870
the table to the left
of the slide are

10
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.540
relative to the start of
the logical volume itself.

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.060
That would be like your C volume,

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.280
your D volume, your E volume.

13
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.520
They're not relative
to the physical disk.

14
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.190
We can see, we have quite
a bit of information and

15
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.810
the information highlighted in

16
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.770
yellow are the structures
we're going to talk about.

17
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.050
So we see we can tell
what file system we have.

18
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.720
You'll have the number
of hidden sectors,

19
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.005
the number of total sectors.

20
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.805
We have our first FAT sector,

21
00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:08.355
and we're going to see
our total clusters,

22
00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:10.385
the location of the root cluster

23
00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:12.620
that will contain
our root directory.

24
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.170
We'll have a volume
serial number,

25
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.110
bytes per sector shift.

26
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.300
Now that means byte per sectors,

27
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.700
we'll talk a little bit
about that in a minute.

28
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.010
Then we see below that
sectors per cluster shift,

29
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.070
and what that does mean
is sectors per cluster.

30
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.650
You're also going to
see the number of FATs,

31
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.024
which will usually
be one in exFAT,

32
00:01:40.024 --> 00:01:42.950
and then we will have
down at the bottom

33
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.820
our boot sector
signature of 55 AA.

34
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.230
Now getting back to
bytes per sector,

35
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.765
what you're going to
see there is a value

36
00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:57.050
between nine and 12.

37
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.005
It'll be in hexadecimal,

38
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:03.365
and this value is going
to be two to the power

39
00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:07.865
of whatever number we
have between nine and 12.

40
00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:11.450
It can be anywhere
from 512 bytes per

41
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.780
sector to 4,096 bytes per sector,

42
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.490
and it's the same concept
on the sectors per cluster.

43
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.590
You're going to have a
number there that will

44
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.705
range between 0 and 25.

45
00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:29.690
Again that number,
it will be two to

46
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.430
whatever that number is

47
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.160
that you have
between zero and 25,

48
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.985
and that can give us as
many possible zeros.

49
00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:44.205
It's somewhere between
1 and 33,554,432.

50
00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:49.345
That's quite a large number
of sectors per cluster.

51
00:02:49.345 --> 00:02:51.660
But again, this file system is

52
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.755
designed for large volumes.

53
00:02:55.755 --> 00:02:59.250
We're going to do a
walk-through now of

54
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.445
the exFAT volume boot record.

55
00:03:02.445 --> 00:03:03.890
The items we're going to need for

56
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.035
our walkthrough are
we're going to need

57
00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:12.630
active disk editor and our
exFAT VHD, virtual hard drive.

58
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.370
Let's start our walkthrough.

59
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.745
The first thing we need to
do is attach our exFAT VHD.

60
00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:26.210
We're going to open
up disk management,

61
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.985
we're going to go to
Actions, attach VHD.

62
00:03:31.985 --> 00:03:34.150
We're going to navigate
out to where we

63
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.805
saved our exFAT VHD.

64
00:03:36.805 --> 00:03:39.310
Mine is on my desktop.

65
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.950
We're going to select exFAT VHD,

66
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.645
we're going to click Open,

67
00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:48.310
and then you're going
to go ahead and click

68
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.910
Okay and your VHD will mount.

69
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.935
Once we've done that,

70
00:03:56.935 --> 00:04:01.325
we're going to locate
the VHD that we mounted.

71
00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:04.990
It should be labeled exFAT.

72
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:14.220
For me, it's physical Disk 13,

73
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.400
logical drive F boot
up volume level,

74
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.665
you can see here of exFAT,

75
00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:26.205
and it's a 182 megabytes.

76
00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:28.960
Make sure you have
the correct drive,

77
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.435
remember the drive, the
physical disk number,

78
00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:34.655
and the logical drive letter.

79
00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:39.085
Now let's go ahead and
launch Active Disk Editor.

80
00:04:39.085 --> 00:04:42.330
Once Active Disk Editor opens up,

81
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.360
we're going to
select "Open disk."

82
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.750
Now we're going to
select volumes.

83
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.735
Because we want to look
at the logical volume,

84
00:04:53.735 --> 00:05:00.390
and then we're going to
select our exFAT file system.

85
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.115
Mine is right here, drive F,

86
00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:07.060
you drive letter, will
probably be different.

87
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.610
Once you've located
it select it and

88
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.385
click ''Open,'' and
it will open up.

89
00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:16.945
Now, it takes us right to
the volume boot record,

90
00:05:16.945 --> 00:05:20.200
and we can see
right at the top of

91
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.765
the volume boot
record in the ASCII,

92
00:05:22.765 --> 00:05:25.900
up here we see the words EXFAT,

93
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.270
and this is the type of

94
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.250
file system that
we're looking at.

95
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.990
If you're not seeing
what I'm seeing,

96
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.510
check your template to

97
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.255
make sure you're on
exFAT boot sector,

98
00:05:40.255 --> 00:05:42.910
and go ahead and
right-click "Set Template

99
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.690
Position," and you'll
be able to see that.

100
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.050
We have our jump instructions,

101
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.960
and then we have our
file system here

102
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.990
highlighted in green,
identified as exFAT.

103
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.920
Moving down, we can see we
have our hidden sectors.

104
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.790
We have our total sectors.

105
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.770
Our hidden sectors are
located right here.

106
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.580
If we look at the value of that,

107
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.480
we can see it's
interpreted for us.

108
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.940
It's 32,768 hidden sectors.

109
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.474
Then we have our total sectors,

110
00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:39.295
the total sectors on the drive.

111
00:06:39.295 --> 00:06:40.840
We want to know that

112
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.250
because we want to
be able to account

113
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.920
for all the space on the drive.

114
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:51.070
We can see that
number is 372,736,

115
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.875
and it is located right here.

116
00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:57.325
If we were to go ahead
and highlight that,

117
00:06:57.325 --> 00:07:03.260
and then take a look down
at our hex interpreter,

118
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:09.250
we can see it is a
32-bit unsigned integer,

119
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:16.810
and we do have the same
number of 372,736,

120
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.970
which is what we have up here
also in our total sectors.

121
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.255
We can see that our tool is
interpreting it correctly.

122
00:07:25.255 --> 00:07:27.250
We have our first FAT sector.

123
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.440
This is where the FAT
table is located,

124
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.030
the first sector
of our FAT table,

125
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.430
and that's going
to be sector 128.

126
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:39.040
We have the total number of
sectors in the FAT table,

127
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.300
and that is 368 total sectors.

128
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.170
We also have our total
clusters on the drive,

129
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:53.030
which is going to be 46,528.

130
00:07:53.790 --> 00:08:00.009
Our root cluster is
going to be cluster 6,

131
00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:03.650
which is what we would
expect it to be.

132
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:11.030
We have our serial number
and hexadecimal over here.

133
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.780
This is where we
have our bytes per

134
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.265
sector shift and our
sectors per cluster shift.

135
00:08:24.265 --> 00:08:28.480
Now, you can see are bytes
per sector shift says nine,

136
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.865
so what we would have to do

137
00:08:30.865 --> 00:08:34.490
is we're going to bring up
the Windows calculator,

138
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.480
we're going to put it
to scientific view,

139
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.090
and we remember it
would be two to

140
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.885
the power of nine to
find that number.

141
00:08:49.885 --> 00:08:54.910
What we'd do is we'll do
two and go to the x^y,

142
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.425
and then go to nine equals 512.

143
00:08:59.425 --> 00:09:03.280
We have 512 bytes per sector.

144
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.640
Now when we look at our
sector per cluster shift,

145
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.395
which is right next to it,

146
00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:10.824
which is a three,

147
00:09:10.824 --> 00:09:14.480
we'd do the same calculation.

148
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.735
We'd go two to the third power,

149
00:09:22.735 --> 00:09:30.925
so it'd be 2, the
x^y, 3 equals 8.

150
00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:35.185
We have eight
sectors per cluster.

151
00:09:35.185 --> 00:09:38.710
Five-hundred-and-twelve
bytes per sector,

152
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.305
and eight sectors per cluster,

153
00:09:41.305 --> 00:09:42.880
and that would be
how you would read

154
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.360
the sector and cluster shifts.

155
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.485
The number of FATs is one,

156
00:09:50.485 --> 00:09:53.420
which is what you would
expect to see in exFAT.

157
00:09:54.870 --> 00:10:02.000
Then we have our signature
down at the bottom of 55, AA.

158
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.905
That will conclude
our walk-through

159
00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:12.190
of the exFAT volume boot record.

160
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.470
In our next module,

161
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.290
we're going to take a look
at the exFAT root directory

162
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.210
in how we interpret

163
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.700
the entries in the
exFAT root directory.
