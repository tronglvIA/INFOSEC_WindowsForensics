00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.175
In this course, Course 10,

2
00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:06.630
we're going to be talking
about the exFAT file system.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.740
This course is going to cover

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.275
knowledge of critical
data structures

5
00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:15.120
in the FAT file system.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.190
We're going to understand how

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.575
the FAT file does file recovery.

8
00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:23.280
We're going to talk about
the exFAT directory tree,

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.415
and folder, and file recovery

10
00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:29.265
limitations within
the FAT file system.

11
00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:32.910
In Module 1, we're
going to talk about

12
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.650
file system overview and

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.170
history of the exFAT file system.

14
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.255
exFAT was first supported
by Windows CE in 2006.

15
00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:49.550
It has a maximum volume
size of 64 zettabytes.

16
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.115
That is a very large volume.

17
00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:55.945
This file system was
designed for large volumes.

18
00:00:55.945 --> 00:01:00.800
It's file size limitation
is 16 exabytes.

19
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.460
It's designed for large
volumes and large files.

20
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.185
It's used mainly
on external media,

21
00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:11.465
it is cross-platform, it will run

22
00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:14.690
on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

23
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.840
If you have a removable
media that you

24
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.590
intend to use on different
operating systems,

25
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.610
you would probably want to
format that volume exFAT.

26
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.865
Now the volume structure,

27
00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:34.980
we have a volume boot
sector like we have in FAT,

28
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.800
we have a backup boot sector,

29
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.725
and we have one FAT.

30
00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.660
We don't have the two FATs,

31
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.075
we only have one FAT in exFAT,

32
00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:46.950
one file allocation table.

33
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.720
Then we have the data area,

34
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.165
which is also referred
to as a cluster heap.

35
00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:57.250
So we do have a system
area and a data area.

36
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.120
The system area has
our boot record,

37
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.320
our backup boot record,

38
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.135
and our file allocation table.

39
00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:07.775
The data area is where we
store our files and folders.

40
00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:10.920
Now, we only have one FAT table.

41
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.390
This version of FAT does use

42
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.935
a full 32 bytes for its entries.

43
00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:22.220
It's going to have a media
descriptor of FF, FF,

44
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.795
FF, F8, and that is
the same as FAT32.

45
00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:33.555
The difference with FAT32
and exFAT is exFAT,

46
00:02:33.555 --> 00:02:38.000
the file allocation table
only tracks fragmented files.

47
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.625
If a file is not fragmented,

48
00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:44.485
it won't have an entry in
the file allocation table.

49
00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:47.160
The file allocation table does

50
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.505
not track cluster allocation.

51
00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:53.820
ExFAT uses a bitmap to track

52
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.920
cluster allocation like NTFS.

53
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.990
There are two system
files we're going to

54
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.440
see in exFAT that we
don't see in FAT32,

55
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.200
and that's the bitmap
and the UpCase table.

56
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.630
The bitmap, like I said,

57
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.955
is used to track
cluster allocation.

58
00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:15.845
It tracks what
clusters are in use,

59
00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:19.600
and what clusters are
available to be written to.

60
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.865
The UpCase table is just a
table of unicode characters.

61
00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:26.505
This is used for searching.

62
00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:28.140
It converts the characters

63
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.480
so you can do a
search of the drive.

64
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.490
The system files will

65
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.190
have an entry in
the root directory,

66
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.370
but that directory entry
does not have a filename.

67
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.170
We'll look at that when we look

68
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.305
at the exFAT root directory.

69
00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:46.340
In our next module,

70
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.900
we're going to take a look at

71
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.730
the exFAT volume boot record.
