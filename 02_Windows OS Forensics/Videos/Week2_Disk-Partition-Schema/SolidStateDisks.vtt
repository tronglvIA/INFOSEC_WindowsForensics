00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.490
Course 3, module 6.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.708
In this module, we're going to
talk about solid state drives, and

3
00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:10.861
some of the ways they differ from
the traditional spinning disks.

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:20.240
Solid state drives do not have cylinders
or spindles or any moving parts at all.

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.192
They're made up of NAND flash memory
chips, and you can see in the slide,

6
00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:30.608
see the memory chips,
we can see the power terminal and

7
00:00:30.608 --> 00:00:34.840
the data terminal,
this is a SATA connection.

8
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.550
Solid state drives cannot overwrite
data like our spinning drives can,

9
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.150
so once something is marked as deleted,
were sent to the recycle pan and

10
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.040
no longer in use,
that area can't simply be overwritten.

11
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.461
That area must be white cleaned
before it can be written to again.

12
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.350
And that's different than our
traditional spinning disks.

13
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.883
Data is written to a solid
state drives called pages, and

14
00:01:09.883 --> 00:01:14.701
it's deleted in blocks, and
blocks are made up of multiple pages.

15
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:19.340
We can think of pages like sectors and
blocks like clusters.

16
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.251
It's not exactly the same, but
it's a way to think about it.

17
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.818
So we're deleting data
in multiple pages box.

18
00:01:27.818 --> 00:01:34.767
Now, a lot of things happen with SSD
solid state drives behind the scenes,

19
00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:40.059
and this happens as soon as
power is applied to the drive,

20
00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:44.161
the user has no control
on how this happens.

21
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.540
Some of the things that happen are wear
leveling, trim and garbage collection.

22
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.183
Now, wear leveling, even it spreads
out to write across the chips,

23
00:01:55.183 --> 00:02:00.305
not to write to the same chip multiple
times, because each of these chips has

24
00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:06.140
a finite amount of writes that it's going
to be able to do before it goes bad.

25
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.287
So by wear leveling, you increase
the longevity of the drive itself.

26
00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:18.390
Trim identifies the areas of the chips
that are no longer in use and it wipes it.

27
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.232
This happens like I said
behind the scenes, so

28
00:02:23.232 --> 00:02:29.201
that's going to change where
the area of data is stored.

29
00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:34.025
Garbage collection actually reorganizes
the data, putting files that

30
00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:38.846
are no longer use or areas of the drives
that are no more in use on one chip,

31
00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:42.482
and taking files from areas
that are still allocated,

32
00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:47.251
that is still in use and moving them
somewhere else on the drive itself.

33
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.596
So it's going to reorganize the data, and

34
00:02:52.596 --> 00:02:57.881
then when that happens,
trim comes through and wipes the chips.

35
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.640
So this can change theoretically,
the hash value of your drive.

36
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.816
You just by applying power to it,

37
00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:11.900
a write blocker won't stop this from
happening, there's no way to stop it.

38
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.851
It happens as soon as power
is applied to the disk.

39
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.950
So I just want you to be aware of that,
and

40
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.861
that only applies to solid state drives.
