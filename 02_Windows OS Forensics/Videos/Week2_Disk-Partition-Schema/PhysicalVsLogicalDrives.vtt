1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.140
Course three disk partition schemas.

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.051
Throughout this course we're going to take
a look at the logical and physical drives.

3
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.416
I don't understand why we need to
know the difference between those and

4
00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:17.921
how that will impact us.

5
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:22.869
During a forensic investigation,
we're going to take a look at sectors and

6
00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.240
clusters.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.692
We're going to come to understand how to
recognize those structures on disks and

8
00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:30.440
what they mean to us.

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.341
I'm going to look at different
partitioning methods,

10
00:00:33.341 --> 00:00:36.180
mainly would petition table and
master boot record and

11
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.961
we're going to learn how to locate
the partitions by reading the table.

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.122
We're going to learn how to recognize
the data structures such as

13
00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:47.170
what is in the master boot record
in the master partition table.

14
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.213
Also the partition table and we're going
to learn how to identify different

15
00:00:52.213 --> 00:00:56.703
types of file systems by looking
at the data structures Mulele one,

16
00:00:56.703 --> 00:01:00.564
we're going to talk about logical and
physical drives and

17
00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:04.061
what the differences are and
how we recognize that.

18
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.161
We're going to talk about the components
of the physical hard drive.

19
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.682
Well, our physical drive,
our regular spitting disk is encased and

20
00:01:15.682 --> 00:01:20.052
underneath the case, if we were to take
that apart, we could see some platters

21
00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:23.940
would seek a spindle in the middle
which spins the platters.

22
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.656
We would see some heads that go back and
forth across the disk and write and

23
00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:31.979
read data to and from the disk and
the actuator arm,

24
00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.261
which is what aligns the heads and moves
them back and forth across the platters.

25
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.422
This is a view of a physical disk and

26
00:01:41.422 --> 00:01:44.963
you can see the platters look
kind of like a CD or DVD and

27
00:01:44.963 --> 00:01:49.490
in the middle we have our spindles and
then we have the actuator arm.

28
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.861
And at the end of the actuator
arm we have the head.

29
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.741
Now when we look at the platters, The
first platter is known as platter zero.

30
00:01:57.741 --> 00:02:02.561
That would be the one on top,
the side facing upward towards us,

31
00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:07.340
With besides zero,
the bottom of that would beside one.

32
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.960
And then underneath that the next platter
would be known as platter one And

33
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.269
its top side, it's side facing up,

34
00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.740
would be side to the side facing
down would be site three.

35
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.025
The heads worked in much the same way the
top head would behead zero on the first

36
00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:29.340
platter, her head on the bottom of
platter, zero would behead one.

37
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.564
Then going down to platter,
one would have had to on The top and

38
00:02:33.564 --> 00:02:35.940
head three on the bottom.

39
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.812
We want to talk about the logical
structure is what we just talked about was

40
00:02:39.812 --> 00:02:41.700
the physical layout of a spitting.

41
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.440
A traditional hard drive, not an SSD,
but a regular spinning drive.

42
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.326
What we're going to talk about now is
going to talk about the logical structures

43
00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:54.470
on that drive first I want to talk
about is low level formatting.

44
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.640
This is laying down the tracks and
sectors on the surface of the hardest.

45
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.808
This is done at the manufacturer's,

46
00:03:01.808 --> 00:03:06.161
it's not something you would have control
over as a user when you buy a disk.

47
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:10.440
It comes with the tracks and
sectors already laid down on it.

48
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.336
Now a track is the centric circle
that goes around the disk and

49
00:03:15.336 --> 00:03:20.440
you can see it represented our
diagram there as a white circle.

50
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.944
Those would be considered the tracks,
they're smaller in the middle and

51
00:03:25.944 --> 00:03:31.180
as you get out towards the edge of
the disk, they become larger sectors

52
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.881
are I like to think of them as
little pie pieces, you can see them

53
00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:41.540
represented there in the yellow and
they are wedges within the disk.

54
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.240
So a sector could take up
many tracks within it.

55
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.280
But the sector is just a little pipi
slice of the disk in what you want

56
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.740
to remember is is the smallest
muted of storage on the platter.

57
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.331
The sector is the smallest unit
unit of storage on the platter And

58
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:04.231
they're usually 512 bytes in size.

59
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:06.351
And we'll talk more about
that as we go through.

60
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.204
Now, a cluster is a group of sectors,
is the easiest way to explain that and

61
00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:17.495
that is something that is done during high
level formatting and talk more about that

62
00:04:17.495 --> 00:04:23.240
in the next section, but they can vary in
size depending on the size of your disk.

63
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.621
What you want to remember about.

64
00:04:24.621 --> 00:04:27.761
A cluster is a cluster has
to do with allocation.

65
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.800
A cluster is used to store data.

66
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.660
It's the area we assign to store.

67
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.170
Data.

68
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.011
Data is stored in clusters.

69
00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:40.501
It's allocated or stored in clusters.

70
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.161
In our next module.

71
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.961
We're going to talk more about sectors and
clusters.
