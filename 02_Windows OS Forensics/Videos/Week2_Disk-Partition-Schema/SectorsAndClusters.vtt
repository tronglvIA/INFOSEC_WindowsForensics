00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
Course 3, Module 2.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.550
In this module,
we're going to talk

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.250
about sectors and clusters.

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.965
Sectors, like we talked
about in our last section,

5
00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:18.135
are formatted during
low-level formatting.

6
00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:19.770
They are written
to the disk during

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.690
low-level formatting which is

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.625
performed by the manufacturer.

9
00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.950
In order for our
operating system to be

10
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.110
able to read from these sectors,

11
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.630
they must have an address for

12
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.550
the operating system
to locate and read

13
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.740
and write data to and
from the sectors.

14
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.100
Sectors are also relative
to the physical disk,

15
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.865
which means they can be
relative to the physical disk,

16
00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:44.630
meaning that the disk

17
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.060
itself from the
absolute sector zero,

18
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.835
absolute meeting prior
to the operating system,

19
00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:53.510
sectors will have addresses that

20
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.240
is relative to the
physical disk itself

21
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.640
and not the volume

22
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.450
within the drive itself,
that physical drive.

23
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.250
But we'll talk more about
that as we go along.

24
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.410
Again, this is performed
by the manufacturer.

25
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.130
They are usually
512 bytes in size.

26
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.050
That can vary with

27
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.390
advanced format disks
where then they'll be

28
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.060
4,096 bytes in size.

29
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.390
But those disks are marked

30
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.125
AAF and you will be
able to recognize them.

31
00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:27.740
Sectors are the
smallest readable unit

32
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.610
on a disk and the smallest
writeable unit on a disk,

33
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.730
and that's going to become
important as we move along.

34
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.900
Sector numbering starts at zero,

35
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.620
and that's very important to
remember because when we're

36
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.330
locating items on our disk

37
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.735
like our partitions
or a specific file,

38
00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:46.830
and we have to calculate
that numbering,

39
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.890
we have to remember
that it starts at zero,

40
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.215
so we must always
account from zero.

41
00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:55.405
Sector numbering can be
physical or logical.

42
00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:58.160
If it's physical, it's usually

43
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.545
relating prior to the
operating system,

44
00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:03.050
but it can also be addressed in

45
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.570
a physical address or
a logical address.

46
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.400
The physical address
would be from

47
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.260
the start of the disk and

48
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.120
the logical address would be from

49
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.640
the start of the volume
or the partition.

50
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.840
How are these sectors addressed?

51
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.370
Well, we use something called

52
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.485
logical block address or an LBA,

53
00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:26.300
is what is used on all
modern hard drives today.

54
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.480
When you look at your
label on your hard drive,

55
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.740
as you can see in the diagram on

56
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.110
the slide, you can see our disk,

57
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.285
we have an LBA, we
look to the right,

58
00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:36.980
highlighted in pink there.

59
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.800
We have a number.

60
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.090
Now that is the
logical block address,

61
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.140
with status keeping us

62
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.245
the total number of
sectors on the disk.

63
00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:47.795
That is the total
number of sectors.

64
00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:50.390
If we wanted to find the
total number of bytes,

65
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.900
we would multiply the LBA
times our sector size,

66
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.745
which is usually going to be 512,

67
00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:58.160
and that would give
us our total number

68
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.085
of bytes on the disk.

69
00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:02.270
Also on this disk label,

70
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.350
we can see a capacity of

71
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.405
one terabyte,
highlighted in blue,

72
00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:08.225
we have the serial number
down here in green,

73
00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:11.330
and a model number down
here highlighted in yellow.

74
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.790
These is all important
information you want to

75
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.865
note on your hard drives
because this serial number

76
00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:19.790
is going to be different
than the serial number

77
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.260
on the outside of
the computer case

78
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.805
and you always want
to make note of that.

79
00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:26.810
Like I said, sectors are
numbered sequentially,

80
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.429
so we'll have sector 0,

81
00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.815
then sector 1, 2, 3, 4,

82
00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:34.260
all the way continuing
to the end of the drive.

83
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.130
Legacy addressing
or cylinder, head,

84
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.250
sector, CHS addressing
is no longer used.

85
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.400
This was relative to

86
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.620
the structure of the
physical drive itself.

87
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.330
It took into account
the number of

88
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.580
cylinders, heads, and sectors.

89
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.890
We looked at cylinders

90
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.290
and heads when we looked
at the physical structure,

91
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.775
that is layout, in
our previous module.

92
00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:00.980
This was relative to the
physical structure of the drive,

93
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.370
but it was limited
to 8.2 gigabytes,

94
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.310
and most modern drives
are going to be much

95
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.365
larger than 8.2 gigabytes.

96
00:04:11.365 --> 00:04:14.390
This also has to do with
the number of bytes

97
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.850
available to address the sectors,

98
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.750
only allowed us to address
up to 8.2 gigabytes.

99
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.430
We're going to talk
more about sector

100
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.855
addressing as we go
through this course.

101
00:04:25.855 --> 00:04:28.590
Clusters. Clusters,
like we learned,

102
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.155
were a group of sectors,

103
00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:33.085
and these are written during
high-level of formatting.

104
00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:34.790
When we format a drive,

105
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.955
we have the option to
set the cluster size

106
00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:41.575
or it can be set automatically
by the operating system.

107
00:04:41.575 --> 00:04:44.840
Cluster size will vary
with the size of the disk.

108
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.230
The larger the disk, usually
the larger the cluster size.

109
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.090
The most common cluster size

110
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.160
you're going to see
is eight sectors,

111
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.505
but it does vary with
the size of the disk.

112
00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:59.270
Cluster numbering starts at one,

113
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.980
not zero, like sectors.

114
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.340
Cluster numerating starts at one.

115
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.060
Clusters are going to be

116
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.675
relative to the
partition of the volume,

117
00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:09.160
to that drive letter.

118
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.480
Cluster of one would
start at the beginning,

119
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.590
say of our C drive,

120
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.300
for example, not at

121
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.565
the beginning of the
physical disk itself.

122
00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:18.800
They are relative to the volume.

123
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.330
Clusters are the
smallest allocable unit.

124
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.465
What that means is when
you write a file to disk,

125
00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:29.600
the operating system saves a
certain amount of space for

126
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.970
that file and it's going
to save it in clusters.

127
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.380
It's going to save, say,
two clusters for that file.

128
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.650
It can't save 1.5 or
one and a quarter,

129
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.185
it has to save by full clusters.

130
00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:47.495
So there will be
leftover space usually

131
00:05:47.495 --> 00:05:49.100
because most files
aren't going to be

132
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.310
exactly the same size
as the clusters.

133
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.725
They won't usually end
on a cluster boundary.

134
00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:56.660
We'll talk more about
that space that's

135
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.370
left over as we go
through this path.

136
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.305
Unpartitioned space.

137
00:06:02.305 --> 00:06:04.820
This is space that is going to

138
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.760
be prior to the start
of the logical volume.

139
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.180
Before my C drive
actually starts,

140
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.230
there is space on

141
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.140
my physical disk prior
to that logical volume,

142
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.365
then that is considered
unpartitioned space.

143
00:06:18.365 --> 00:06:21.170
That's going to be addressed
in sectors and it's

144
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.460
going to be relative to
the physical disk itself.

145
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.690
What we're going to find
here is usually like

146
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.760
our master boot
record, our boot code,

147
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.640
our partition tables and
we're not going to have

148
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.155
cluster addressing in this area.

149
00:06:35.155 --> 00:06:37.290
In our next module,

150
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.830
we are going to go ahead
and learn how to use

151
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.320
active disk editor so we can take

152
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.645
a look at these data
structures on disk

153
00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:48.270
and get a better look into
what we're talking about.
