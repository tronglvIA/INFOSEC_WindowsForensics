00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Course 3, module 5,

2
00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:04.155
we're going to talk about

3
00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:08.950
the GUID partition table
schema throughout this module.

4
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.880
The GUID partition table
is what you're going to

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.790
see on most of your
modern disk today.

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.140
It works through

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.020
globally unique
identifiers called GUIDs.

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.845
A GUID is 128-bit value

9
00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:29.325
and its use to uniquely
identify something.

10
00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:34.425
It's expressed in an
8-4-4-4-12 format

11
00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:37.265
and we can see an
example of that below.

12
00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:41.540
This will overcome the
two terabyte restriction

13
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.400
that Master Boot Record has.

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.040
Because remember when we talked
about Master Boot Record,

15
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.340
we talked about our
maximum values.

16
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.710
We only have four bytes to
address them and we can

17
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.110
address them at FF FF FF.

18
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.260
But that restricts us to two
terabytes of addressing.

19
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.395
This will overcome that
two terabyte restriction.

20
00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:04.970
You will still see

21
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.045
a protective Master Boot
Record in sector 0,

22
00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.500
and that is there so Windows
does not try to format

23
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.835
the disk because there
is nothing in sector 0,

24
00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:18.950
your file system, a Windows

25
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.055
file system we'll try
to format the drive.

26
00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:28.145
The partition table contains
up to 128 partition entries.

27
00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:31.690
Each of these entries
is 128 bytes long.

28
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.625
Now you might remember back
when we talked about MBR,

29
00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:36.290
we only had 16 bytes

30
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.795
to describe and address
our partitions.

31
00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:41.315
Here we have 128 bytes.

32
00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.065
That gives us a lot more room.

33
00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:47.425
Our partition table header

34
00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:50.590
is located in physical sector 1.

35
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.410
There is a backup copy at
the end of the disk and

36
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.250
it uses quiz to identify
each partition,

37
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.650
the type, and also to uniquely
identify the partition.

38
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.630
It's in physical sector 1
because in physical sector

39
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.490
0 we have that protective
aster Boot Record.

40
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.110
This is a visual layout of

41
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.025
how a GPT formatted
disk will look.

42
00:02:15.025 --> 00:02:17.390
You can see right up in sector 0

43
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.900
we have our protective
Master Boot Record.

44
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.275
In sector 1, we have
our GPT header.

45
00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:26.705
In sector 2, we have

46
00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:31.370
our GUID partition table
entries starting in sector 2.

47
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.190
Starting in sector 34,

48
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.875
is where you're going to see
your first actual partition,

49
00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:38.810
your first data
partition that will

50
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.270
contain data and then you'll see

51
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.910
below that the remaining
partitions and then at

52
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.260
the end of the drive we have
a backup copy of the GPT,

53
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.970
the GUID partition table,

54
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.060
and a backup copy
of the GPT header.

55
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.350
The protective master
boot record, like I said,

56
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.515
prevents the operating system
from formatting the drive.

57
00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:03.260
There will be a single entry in

58
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.690
there that will span
the entire drive.

59
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.155
It will account for
all data on the drive,

60
00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:10.470
you'll see a partition type of

61
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.105
EE and it will start with 1,

62
00:03:15.105 --> 00:03:17.065
showing us sector 1,

63
00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:23.430
and then showing us the
maximum value, FF FF FF.

64
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.580
This is what you'll see in

65
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.105
the protective
master boot record.

66
00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:31.720
The GPT header, remember,

67
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.190
is much larger and we have
a signature at the start of

68
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.930
the header and it's
eight bytes long and

69
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.605
it's going to say and
ask you EFI part.

70
00:03:43.605 --> 00:03:48.020
So if you're looking at a disk
and you look in sector 1,

71
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.430
and you see this EFI part,

72
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.315
you know you're looking at
a quick partition schema.

73
00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:56.095
You know you're
looking at a GPT disk.

74
00:03:56.095 --> 00:04:01.950
Now, a logical doubt
it hexadecimal 2,

75
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.940
0, we're going to see

76
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.060
the location of the
backup copy of the GPT.

77
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.815
How we do this in hex
is we start here,

78
00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:14.200
we got out two and
we can see this is

79
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.355
the address of the
backup copy of the GPT.

80
00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:22.630
It's used for recovery purposes.

81
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.145
Now at offset 2,

82
00:04:26.145 --> 00:04:28.500
8 so you go down 1,

83
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.515
2 and over 8.

84
00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:34.970
We can see the start
of the partition area.

85
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.580
This is going to tell us where
the partition area starts.

86
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.320
At offset 3, 0,

87
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.895
this is going to tell us where
the partition area ends.

88
00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:52.215
These are the actual
partitions around the drive.

89
00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:56.160
Now, down at offset 3,

90
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.750
8, we see our disk GUID.

91
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.890
This GUID uniquely identifies
this particular disk.

92
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.125
It is 16 bytes long.

93
00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:07.390
It starts here and goes down.

94
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.385
It's outlined in green.

95
00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:11.830
That's our disk GUID and it is

96
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.205
a unique identifier
for a particular disk.

97
00:05:15.205 --> 00:05:18.880
At offset 48, we

98
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.890
see where the partition table

99
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.310
starts and we can see if we,

100
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.265
all these values are
read little-endian.

101
00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:29.185
Just want to let you know
that we talked about

102
00:05:29.185 --> 00:05:33.050
endianness back at the
beginning of this path.

103
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.370
We can see that that's
going to be two,

104
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.230
which says sector 2.

105
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.710
Each entry, like I said,

106
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.055
is a 128 bytes long.

107
00:05:45.055 --> 00:05:48.280
The beginning of the
entry starting at offset

108
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.835
00 is going to be the
partition type GUID.

109
00:05:51.835 --> 00:05:53.380
What that means is,

110
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.850
what type of partition is it?

111
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.010
Is it a basic data partition?

112
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.145
Is it an EFI system partition?

113
00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:03.100
Is it a reserved partition?

114
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.965
What type of partition is it?

115
00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:07.570
Then down at offset

116
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.270
10 we're going to see
the partitioning GUID.

117
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.560
This GUID uniquely
identifies that partition.

118
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.685
So you'll see partition type
GUIDs which are not unique.

119
00:06:18.685 --> 00:06:22.120
They'll be consistent from
disk to disk and they'll

120
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.615
identify the type of
partition you're looking at,

121
00:06:25.615 --> 00:06:27.370
but the partition GUID is

122
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.255
a unique identifier and
that will become important.

123
00:06:31.255 --> 00:06:33.295
Then at offset to 20,

124
00:06:33.295 --> 00:06:36.070
you're going to see the
start of the partition where

125
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.894
the partition starts
and then at offset 28,

126
00:06:39.894 --> 00:06:41.230
you're going to
see the address of

127
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.465
where the partition ends.

128
00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:46.075
At offset 30, we're going to see

129
00:06:46.075 --> 00:06:49.120
partition flags such as
read-only or hidden,

130
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.155
or other attributes of the
file of that partition.

131
00:06:53.155 --> 00:06:55.195
Then at offset 38,

132
00:06:55.195 --> 00:06:59.230
you're going to see the name
of the partition in Unicode.

133
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.155
Let's take a look here.

134
00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:06.220
These are some common
GUID partition types and

135
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.315
this is shown in hex as
you'll see them on this.

136
00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:12.370
These are converted to GUIDs.

137
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.685
This is in hexadecimal as
you will see it on the disk.

138
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:19.030
This particular GUID
would be an unused entry.

139
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.950
You can see we have
different types of

140
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.995
Linux Swap, Microsoft Reserved,

141
00:07:23.995 --> 00:07:27.400
Microsoft EFI System
partition and

142
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.500
then different types of
partitions depending

143
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.065
on what partition is on there.

144
00:07:32.065 --> 00:07:35.230
Basic data partition, this

145
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.325
shows the partition types
converted to GUIDs.

146
00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:42.925
We can see we have Microsoft
Reserved, basic data,

147
00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:44.905
Windows Recovery Environment,

148
00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:47.140
just different types
of partitions.

149
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.295
Like I said, the type GUID
is not a unique identifier,

150
00:07:51.295 --> 00:07:57.110
these GUIDS will be consistent
across operating systems.

151
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.249
This slide shows us an example

152
00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:02.770
of a partition table entry.

153
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.170
This would be in single entry

154
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.915
in the GUID partition table.

155
00:08:07.915 --> 00:08:12.895
We can see we have
the first 16 bytes,

156
00:08:12.895 --> 00:08:14.920
and this is the type GUID.

157
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:20.245
You can see it starts with A2
and ends down here with C7.

158
00:08:20.245 --> 00:08:23.545
This tells us what type of
partition we're looking at.

159
00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:26.965
If we go down one line,

160
00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:30.010
we can now see the
volume GUID and it

161
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.535
starts with 2C and ends with 2A.

162
00:08:33.535 --> 00:08:36.160
This is that unique identifier

163
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.305
that identifies that volume,

164
00:08:38.305 --> 00:08:43.550
that identifies that individual
partition on the drive.

165
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:49.390
If we go down another line to 30,

166
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:54.055
we see the logical block address,

167
00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:56.770
the start of the partition

168
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.545
where those particular
partitioning starts.

169
00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:10.375
We can see it's down here
and it starts at LBA 32,768.

170
00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:13.360
Remember these are
read little-endian,

171
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.340
so up here we can
see we've converted

172
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.200
to little-endian and we've

173
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.110
translated that
hexadecimal value to

174
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.600
a decimal value and
now we know where

175
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.590
the start of this
particular partition is.

176
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.975
The next eight bytes,

177
00:09:28.975 --> 00:09:31.750
we can see down here
on disk starts with

178
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.640
FF and ends with 00 for a
length them eight bytes.

179
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.750
This is telling us the
end of that partition,

180
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.720
where the partition ends.

181
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.080
Again, we would convert
it to little-endian,

182
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.750
like we've done up
here and you can see,

183
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.170
and this is the ending LBA and

184
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.050
when we translate
that hex to decimal,

185
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.795
we get the address of

186
00:09:58.795 --> 00:10:01.030
the end of the
logical block address

187
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.160
for that particular partition.

188
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.085
We have the startup
where the partition

189
00:10:06.085 --> 00:10:11.004
starts and we also have
where the partition ends,

190
00:10:11.004 --> 00:10:13.510
which is something we
did not have when we

191
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.780
looked at our MBR
partition entries.

192
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.190
Now we can see the flags.

193
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.070
This particular one, you can

194
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.605
see down here starts with 00,

195
00:10:26.605 --> 00:10:29.440
ends with hexadecimal 80.

196
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.085
That is the flags.

197
00:10:33.085 --> 00:10:35.290
In this particular case,

198
00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.675
we would again read
it Little Indian.

199
00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:40.585
This particular flag
says, "No drive letter."

200
00:10:40.585 --> 00:10:43.405
It could say, "Hidden."

201
00:10:43.405 --> 00:10:45.505
It could say, "No drive letter."

202
00:10:45.505 --> 00:10:47.350
It could say any other type of

203
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.504
attribute attributed to
that particular partition.

204
00:10:51.504 --> 00:10:54.820
The remainder here shows us

205
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.690
the name of the partition
in hexadecimal,

206
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.494
and if we were to
translate that to ASCII,

207
00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:05.780
we would see that that was
a basic data partition.

208
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.890
What I'd like you to do

209
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.885
now if you haven't
already done so,

210
00:11:10.885 --> 00:11:19.490
is please download the GPT
VHD from the class drive.

211
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:25.300
Please go ahead and
attach that through

212
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:30.910
disk management and open
up Active Disk Editor.

213
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.575
We're going to take a look at

214
00:11:32.575 --> 00:11:36.865
that particular disk
which is formatted GPT,

215
00:11:36.865 --> 00:11:40.150
that VHD in Active Disk Editor,

216
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.240
so we can see what this
all looks like on disk.

217
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:53.000
We are going to go ahead and
bring up disk management.

218
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.635
I want to make sure
that everybody has

219
00:11:56.635 --> 00:11:59.830
attached the VHD,
so if you have not,

220
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:05.545
go to "Actions", "Attach VHD",

221
00:12:05.545 --> 00:12:07.705
navigate out to where you saved

222
00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:12.820
your GPT VHD for this class.

223
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:18.355
Select the VHD, select "Open",

224
00:12:18.355 --> 00:12:23.180
and then you'd go ahead
and attach the VHD.

225
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.215
Once the VHD is attached,

226
00:12:26.215 --> 00:12:32.065
note the drive, note
the disk number,

227
00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:35.450
so when we go to attach it,

228
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.970
we can see it in
Active Disk Editor so

229
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.175
we can select the right disk.

230
00:12:42.175 --> 00:12:46.970
Mine is 15, yours will probably
have a different number.

231
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.265
If we do that one more
time for everybody,

232
00:12:51.265 --> 00:12:55.780
we're going to go to
"Actions", "Attach VHD",

233
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.450
navigate out to where
we saved our class,

234
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.360
"GPT VHD", select it,

235
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.180
select "Open", and we'll

236
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.045
be able to attach it
and just hit "Okay",

237
00:13:07.045 --> 00:13:09.085
and it will attach.

238
00:13:09.085 --> 00:13:11.425
Once you've done that,

239
00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:15.250
note the disk number so we

240
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.760
can find it when we're
using Active Disk Editor.

241
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:25.730
Let's go ahead and open up
Active Disk Editor now.

242
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:32.545
Once Active Disk Editor opens,

243
00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:36.830
we're going to select from
the menu here, "Open Disk",

244
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:41.950
and we're going to go ahead
and select physical drive,

245
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.120
whatever number your
particular GPT VHD

246
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.115
was in Disk Management,

247
00:13:48.115 --> 00:13:50.780
and we're going to click "Open".

248
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.090
Once it opens up,

249
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.570
you can see it here
in physical sector 0,

250
00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.940
and you can see that we're
in physical sector 0.

251
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.455
This is our protective
master boot record.

252
00:14:08.455 --> 00:14:12.070
We're going to go ahead
and change our template

253
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.620
to master boot record for

254
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.185
a minute so we can look at that.

255
00:14:17.185 --> 00:14:20.920
Go back in, make sure
you're on offset 0,

256
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.195
right-click, set
template position.

257
00:14:25.195 --> 00:14:28.150
If you don't set it right
from the beginning,

258
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.485
you set it in the middle,

259
00:14:29.485 --> 00:14:31.910
it will not read correctly.

260
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.030
Once we set our template,

261
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.410
we're going to go ahead and look

262
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.005
at our protective
master boot record.

263
00:14:38.005 --> 00:14:40.240
We have one partition entry

264
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.250
which is what we expect to see,

265
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.930
it is not bootable.

266
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:50.860
Then we would have our
legacy cylinder head sector

267
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.615
and we have our partition
type flag here,

268
00:14:53.615 --> 00:14:55.470
which we can see is EE,

269
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.885
which is what we expect to
see because we know that

270
00:14:57.885 --> 00:15:02.355
a partition type of EE stands
for GUID partition schema.

271
00:15:02.355 --> 00:15:04.775
We're looking at a GPT disk.

272
00:15:04.775 --> 00:15:07.240
Then we would have our
following three bytes

273
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.940
of legacy cylinder head sector,

274
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.580
and we can see the first sector,

275
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.740
like we said, this will
span the whole disk.

276
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.060
It'll go from sector 1
all the way out until

277
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.120
the absolute maximum sectors

278
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.295
it can address using four bytes,

279
00:15:24.295 --> 00:15:27.650
which would be FF, FF, FF.

280
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.050
This is telling me that

281
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.150
this is accounting
for the whole disk.

282
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.040
Remember, we only
have four bytes to

283
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.220
address using master
boot record schema.

284
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.515
With GUID partition table schema,

285
00:15:44.515 --> 00:15:49.255
we have eight bytes to use
for sector addressing,

286
00:15:49.255 --> 00:15:54.320
which will allow us to
address a lot more sectors.

287
00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:02.305
Now, we're going to look
at our EFI part, sector 1.

288
00:16:02.305 --> 00:16:06.730
This is the GPT header
is in sector 1.

289
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.625
We do not have a
template for this.

290
00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:12.890
We're going to go ahead
and go with no template.

291
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:17.030
We're going to
navigate through here.

292
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:21.205
In the header, we see

293
00:16:21.205 --> 00:16:26.425
our signature for a
length of eight bytes.

294
00:16:26.425 --> 00:16:29.440
We can see it says EFI part,

295
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.735
and that lets us know
that we're looking at

296
00:16:31.735 --> 00:16:35.570
a GPT partition disk.

297
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.910
Starting down at 20,

298
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.595
and remember, we count one,

299
00:16:42.595 --> 00:16:48.440
two, 20, for a length
of eight bytes.

300
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.190
We're going to open
up our Data Inspector

301
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.410
here and we're going to

302
00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.560
expand our window up so we
can see our Data Inspector.

303
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.350
This value is read little-endian,

304
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.240
and we can see right here,

305
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:21.609
we get the location of our
backup copy of the GPT.

306
00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:24.430
This tells us where
our backup copy of

307
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.050
our grid partition table will be

308
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.125
located at, which sector?

309
00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:33.650
This is the sector that the
backup copy is located in.

310
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.350
If we look at offset
28, and again,

311
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:45.115
we're starting from the top
of the partition header,

312
00:17:45.115 --> 00:17:49.645
the GPT header, going
down two and over eight.

313
00:17:49.645 --> 00:17:52.210
This is going to be
the start of where

314
00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.790
the GUID partition area is.

315
00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.620
This is where our
partitions are located.

316
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.735
We can see that it's 34,

317
00:18:03.735 --> 00:18:05.970
which is what we
expect because 34 is

318
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.235
where we're going to see the
start of our partition area,

319
00:18:08.235 --> 00:18:12.700
where the actual partitions
are out on the drive.

320
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:18.470
Partition 34 would be the
start of our partition area.

321
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:24.714
Now we're going to look at
offset 30 from the start

322
00:18:24.714 --> 00:18:30.325
of the GPT header,
one, two three.

323
00:18:30.325 --> 00:18:35.930
Again, we're going to look
at a length of eight bytes.

324
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:43.705
This is going to be the end
of where our partitions are,

325
00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:46.640
the end of the partition area.

326
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.255
Now, we're going to
look at our disk GUID,

327
00:18:55.255 --> 00:19:01.555
which is at offset 38 for
a length of 16 bytes.

328
00:19:01.555 --> 00:19:03.775
This is the disk GUID,

329
00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:07.645
this disk GUID uniquely
identifies this physical disk,

330
00:19:07.645 --> 00:19:10.310
it's the disk GUID.

331
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.070
Now we're going to look at

332
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.340
our next eight bytes

333
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.665
and this tells us the start
of our partition table.

334
00:19:23.665 --> 00:19:26.155
The start of our partition table

335
00:19:26.155 --> 00:19:29.335
is located at sector number 2,

336
00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:32.230
we're going to see the start
of the partition table.

337
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.885
That's what we're
going to look at next.

338
00:19:34.885 --> 00:19:37.690
Remember, we're looking
at eight bytes of data,

339
00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.805
8 times 8 is 64,

340
00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:44.390
this is a 64-bit unsigned value.

341
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.345
Looking down at sector 2,

342
00:19:52.345 --> 00:19:54.430
we can see what sector we're in

343
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.780
down here on the
corner, sector 2.

344
00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.790
This is the start of our
GUID partition table.

345
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.790
We're going to go to templates,

346
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.010
and we're going to
go to GPT table.

347
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:12.620
We can see this is the start
of our GUID partition table,

348
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:20.020
and each of these is a GUID
partition table entry.

349
00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.855
They're all 128 bytes long,

350
00:20:22.855 --> 00:20:24.400
and if we were to scroll down,

351
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.635
I could show you there
are a 128 of them.

352
00:20:26.635 --> 00:20:29.125
We're just going to take
a look at the first one.

353
00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:32.600
This tells us what
we're looking at.

354
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.260
This is the partition type

355
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.780
GUID and this is
going to be a length

356
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:45.610
of 16 bytes and that's
our partition type GUID.

357
00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.740
It tells us what type of
partition we're looking at.

358
00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:54.730
Again, it is also
red little-endian.

359
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.270
If we look at that,

360
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.395
we can see it
translates it for us,

361
00:21:04.395 --> 00:21:10.480
it is a Microsoft
Reserved Partition.

362
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.305
If we look here,

363
00:21:15.305 --> 00:21:18.380
this is our unique
partition GUID and again,

364
00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.790
this is also 16 bytes

365
00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:24.300
long and it is the
unique partition GUID.

366
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.525
The first one is the type GUID,

367
00:21:27.525 --> 00:21:29.925
which is a Microsoft
Reserved Partition

368
00:21:29.925 --> 00:21:33.375
and the second one is
the unique identifier,

369
00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:39.205
which is the unique
partition GUID.

370
00:21:39.205 --> 00:21:44.040
Continuing down, we
can see where it

371
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:50.325
starts and it starts
in Sector 34,

372
00:21:50.325 --> 00:21:51.690
which is what we would expect to

373
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.855
see where our first partition is.

374
00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:57.525
Now, we can see where it ends.

375
00:21:57.525 --> 00:22:05.910
It ends in Sector 32,767.

376
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.415
That's the start of our partition

377
00:22:08.415 --> 00:22:11.010
and the end of our partition.

378
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.505
These would be our attributes.

379
00:22:14.505 --> 00:22:17.700
We really don't have any
attribute flags here to

380
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:23.415
see and then we have the
name of our partition.

381
00:22:23.415 --> 00:22:29.110
We can see that it is a
Microsoft Reserved Partition.

382
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.990
Just point out right here
that the type GUID and

383
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.855
the partition name will not
always match because this is

384
00:22:39.855 --> 00:22:42.780
a system partition and
Microsoft Reserved Partition,

385
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.550
in this case, they just
happened to match,

386
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.990
but they won't always match.

387
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.145
Moving down to our next entry,

388
00:22:51.145 --> 00:22:53.305
we see the type GUID

389
00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:56.830
and we can see it's a
basic data partition.

390
00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.065
This is again a unique GUID.

391
00:23:01.065 --> 00:23:04.440
It uniquely identifies this
partition on the drive.

392
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.545
No other partition
on the drive or

393
00:23:07.545 --> 00:23:12.190
subsequently any other drive
should have the same GUID.

394
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.860
This is where our
partition starts.

395
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.830
This is the starting
LBA or starting

396
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.370
sector of this partition
and you can see out

397
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:28.170
here 32,768 and we

398
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.600
see the end of our
partition over here.

399
00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.400
We're getting some big numbers,

400
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.290
2,093,055 and then we see

401
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.740
our attributes which we

402
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.440
do not have any
attribute flag set.

403
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.690
We could have hidden,

404
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.810
we could have different types

405
00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.690
of attributes over here but we

406
00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.700
do not have any
attribute flags set in

407
00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.810
this case and then we have
the name of our partition,

408
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.940
and it's a basic data partition.

409
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:15.465
Our first partition here

410
00:24:15.465 --> 00:24:25.660
started at Sector 34.

411
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:33.570
We'll go to "Sector" and
we're going to say 34,

412
00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.955
and we'll say "Okay".

413
00:24:35.955 --> 00:24:37.935
We don't really have anything

414
00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:40.365
out here at this point in time.

415
00:24:40.365 --> 00:24:56.110
The next one was our
basic data partition,

416
00:24:56.110 --> 00:25:04.380
which started at 32,768 and
we do see something here.

417
00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.645
We can see that our
basic data partition

418
00:25:06.645 --> 00:25:09.390
has a volume boot record.

419
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:18.630
It is formatted NTFS and
you can see here tells

420
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:22.890
you sector we are in and that

421
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:28.360
number matches the number
for our starting sector.

422
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.430
We have our volume boot record,

423
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.325
we don't as of yet
have any data on here,

424
00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:36.920
but we do have a volume
boot record and we can

425
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.680
see that the file system is NTFS.
