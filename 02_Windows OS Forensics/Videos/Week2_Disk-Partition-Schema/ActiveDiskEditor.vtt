1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.330
We are on course three and
we're on module three.

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.970
And in this module we're going to
take a look at active disk editor.

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.905
This is the tool we're going to be
using throughout this path to look

4
00:00:12.905 --> 00:00:16.951
at the data on disk and
the actual system structures.

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.626
When we open up at the disk editor,

6
00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:23.930
this is the first screen we're
going to be presented with.

7
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.340
I'd like you to notice here is you
have the option to open a disk.

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.940
We can't open a disk image file or
you can look at your own computer.

9
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.721
We have the ability here
to open a physical disk.

10
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:42.241
If we were to choose, open a desk well
represented with a menu that showed us all

11
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:46.040
these physical disks
attached to our computer.

12
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.951
So we could go ahead and
open a physical desk.

13
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.661
We also have the option to open a logical
volume as well as open a physical disk.

14
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.605
And we're going to be doing both of
those things and we'll have our walk

15
00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:09.698
through at the end of this module but
we can also open the logical volume and

16
00:01:09.698 --> 00:01:13.751
we do that by selecting the volume and
then clicking open.

17
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.867
One of the nice things about this tool
is it has something called the template

18
00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:24.124
manager which will highlight the data
structures that we want to look at and

19
00:01:24.124 --> 00:01:25.770
there's a drop down arrow.

20
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.873
We can select the type of data we want
to look at that would be a master boot

21
00:01:30.873 --> 00:01:36.090
record with petition table are Nt Fs,
food sectors, fat food sectors.

22
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.651
We're going to look at every single one
of these things throughout this path.

23
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.761
Industrial is going to help us do that.

24
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.411
It has to borrow items which are like
shortcuts that we're going to use to.

25
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:56.346
We're going to use very often is this
navigation and this go to sector.

26
00:01:56.346 --> 00:02:01.750
Navigation deals with system data
structures such as the boot sector,

27
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.191
a root directory or

28
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:09.539
other types of data structures that we
may want to look at a master file table.

29
00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.196
Whereas go to sector is going
to take us to an actual specific

30
00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:17.561
location on the disk, a numbered sector.

31
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.040
We're going to do our walk
through now inactive disk editor.

32
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.601
So I want you to go ahead and
open active disk editor and

33
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:32.340
this is what the icon looks like if you
have not downloaded, here's the URL.

34
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.940
Where you could go out and
downloaded from.

35
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.694
So go ahead and pause the video and
download it and open it up and

36
00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:41.351
we will get started.

37
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.670
Okay, we're going to
start artist editor demo.

38
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.621
The first thing we need to
do is open disk editor.

39
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:50.670
So navigate to the shortcut mayan.

40
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.161
I have down here on my task bar and
we're going to run active disk editor.

41
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.543
Once it opens, we're going to
be presented with the screen and

42
00:03:03.543 --> 00:03:05.460
you can see we can open a disc.

43
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.340
We can open a file.

44
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.200
We can open an image or
we can look at the computer

45
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.361
that the program is installed on for
our purposes.

46
00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:21.001
Right now we're going to go ahead and
open disk and when we do that,

47
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:27.061
we're going to be presented with
a bunch of disks that we can work with.

48
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.940
We're going to pick whichever
disk you would like to.

49
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.261
I'm going to go ahead and
pick this physical disk and click open.

50
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.709
And when I do that it
opens on my computer And

51
00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.861
it opens to sector zero by default.

52
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.661
Now you can see we have our
shortcuts up here on the task bar.

53
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.340
We also have,
I dropped out menu to open the file.

54
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.740
We can add a disk image for navigation.

55
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.080
We have it up here,
you can go to offset sector.

56
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.868
If you click partition table,

57
00:04:14.868 --> 00:04:19.561
it's going to take us right to where we
are the boot sector for the physical disk.

58
00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:25.558
We also have the navigation
shortcuts up here, go to offset,

59
00:04:25.558 --> 00:04:28.140
go to sector and navigate.

60
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.781
We have the two shortcuts again.

61
00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:31.840
And we also have partition table.

62
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.151
We also have the individual partitions.

63
00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:39.621
We can navigate to each of our partitions
that are on our disk that we're

64
00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:40.451
looking at.

65
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.840
One of the tools we're going to use
a lot up here is where templates are.

66
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.601
Now to do this.

67
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:52.134
When you click the dropdown arrow,
use your scroll

68
00:04:52.134 --> 00:04:57.000
wheel on your mouse because if you
just try to scroll, it disappears.

69
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.061
So when you use the drop down
arrow use your scroll wheel.

70
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.420
So that is how we get to our
different types of templates,

71
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.361
which are going to use quite
a bit during this path.

72
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.461
And we opened a physical disk.

73
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.551
Now let's open a volume
on the physical disk.

74
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.505
So we would go to file, open again and

75
00:05:23.505 --> 00:05:28.619
now I'll scroll down to
the disk that I opened and

76
00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:33.608
I'll pick a drive letter
when I open volume T and

77
00:05:33.608 --> 00:05:38.261
I'll click open and
it opens up the volume.

78
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.529
Now when you're navigating on the physical
disk and we click go to sector,

79
00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:47.961
it's only going to allow
you to navigate in sectors.

80
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.991
I cannot navigate in clusters.

81
00:05:51.991 --> 00:05:53.601
If I click on that,

82
00:05:53.601 --> 00:06:00.040
nothing will happen if I use the extended
volume and I go go to sector.

83
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.479
Now I have the option of
navigating in either sectors or

84
00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.233
clusters because I'm in
the logical volume at this point.

85
00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.261
And this is just how this
particular tool works.

86
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.125
Now if I want to navigate to a sector,

87
00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:23.361
I'm going to go ahead and
pick a sector number in here.

88
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.514
Type one end I say, okay,

89
00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:38.340
now it's taken me to a sector.

90
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.627
There's not much on this particular drive,
so

91
00:06:42.627 --> 00:06:46.269
you really can't see too much here, but

92
00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:52.269
it will take you to the numbered
sector that you picked if we pick a So

93
00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:57.305
I want to look at the FT
structure the master file table,

94
00:06:57.305 --> 00:07:00.221
I can pick that right from that.

95
00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:01.504
Drop down menu and

96
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:06.391
will take me right to the start of
the Master file table and see here.

97
00:07:06.391 --> 00:07:07.270
I'm set on.

98
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.996
If we look at our template
were set on NTS boot sector,

99
00:07:12.996 --> 00:07:18.977
we would have to turn around and
pick The one We wanted and

100
00:07:18.977 --> 00:07:25.240
it is not a master boot record,
this is a master file sale.

101
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.570
So we need to find the template for the
master file table, a Master file record.

102
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.330
So we're going to be looking for and

103
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.950
TFS file record and we click that.

104
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.440
It gives us the correct template for
the m f t file record.

105
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.108
And if we ever needed to set the position,
we can set the template

106
00:07:50.108 --> 00:07:55.401
position by just right clicking and
clicking, set template position.

107
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.940
And this shows us the structure
of this file record.

108
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:08.061
We're going to cover what all this data
on this disk means throughout this path.

109
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:14.100
But I just want to show you
how to use this tool from

110
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.860
the drop down options,
the quick access menu or

111
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:24.351
from the file navigation,
open file in the template.

112
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.071
How to use the templates.
