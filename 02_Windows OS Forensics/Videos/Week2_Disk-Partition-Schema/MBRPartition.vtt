1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
We're on Course 3, Module 4.

2
00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:04.410
In this module, we're
going to be talking

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.435
about the master boot record.

4
00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:09.555
The master boot record,
partition schema,

5
00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:11.895
or otherwise known as MBR,

6
00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:17.070
is limited to four entries
in the partition table.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.260
Now, each of these entries
is 16 bytes in length.

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.355
Four bytes for the
partition size,

9
00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:31.125
and that leaves us with a
maximum value of FF, FF,

10
00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:36.590
FF, FF, which will limits us
to two terabytes in size.

11
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.665
Disks larger than two
terabytes must be formatted,

12
00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:42.890
with another partition schema

13
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.630
are known as GUID
partition table,

14
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.510
which we will talk about
in the next block.

15
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.360
The master boot record is
located at physical sector 0,

16
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.070
the very start of the drive.

17
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.610
Each sector is 512 bytes,

18
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.030
and it's going to end
with 55, AA, hexadecimal.

19
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.730
The master boot record is
512 bytes long, one sector,

20
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.785
and it's going to end with

21
00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:17.690
the hexadecimal
representation of 55, AA.

22
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.460
Now, what's in the
master boot record?

23
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.620
Well, you have the beginning,

24
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.340
you're going to
have the boot code.

25
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.145
We're going to have
our disk signature.

26
00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:27.020
We're going to have
our partition table.

27
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.720
That's going to tell us where
each of the partitions,

28
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.005
is located out on the drive.

29
00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:33.770
How big the petitions are,

30
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.630
it's going to give us the
size of the partitions,

31
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.490
and the type of the partitions.

32
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.265
Are they FAT32, NTFS?

33
00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:42.730
What type of petition they are.

34
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.230
This is what the
master boot record is

35
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.075
going to look like on disk.

36
00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:49.130
In the beige up here,

37
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.590
you can see we have
our boot code.

38
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.330
Down here we have our
disk signature in green.

39
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.055
Then each of these,

40
00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:03.080
the pink represents
one partition.

41
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.890
Then we have our second
partition represented

42
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.110
in blue, orange, and green.

43
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.840
We see a maximum of four entries.

44
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.810
We see each of these
entries is 16 bytes long.

45
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.835
It gives us the information.

46
00:02:21.835 --> 00:02:27.735
The first byte here tells
us if it's bootable or not.

47
00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:29.890
This partition represented with

48
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.815
hexadecimal 80 would be bootable,

49
00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:36.350
00 would not be bootable.

50
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.965
The next three bytes are

51
00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:43.925
legacy cylinder head
sector addressing,

52
00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:47.605
which we don't
really use anymore.

53
00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:51.920
The next byte would be
the partition type entry.

54
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.760
In this case, 0c,

55
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.455
and we'll get to talking
about partition types,

56
00:02:56.455 --> 00:02:59.395
and what these
entries mean exactly.

57
00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:01.015
Then our next three bytes,

58
00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:04.880
is again legacy cylinder
head sector addressing.

59
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.305
Then our next four bytes,

60
00:03:07.305 --> 00:03:11.155
are going to tell us the
location of the first partition,

61
00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:13.090
where it starts on disk.

62
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.595
Then the last four
bytes of the entry,

63
00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:20.480
give us the size of the
partition, in sectors.

64
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.965
It can only have four entries.

65
00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:27.245
Only one of these
entries can be bootable.

66
00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:29.860
Only one of these
entries can be what we

67
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.000
call an extended
logical partition,

68
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.510
and we'll talk more about
throughout this path.

69
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.915
The extended logical
partition cannot be bootable.

70
00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:40.930
Out of those four, the extended

71
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.670
logical cannot be bootable.

72
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.100
Only one of them can be bootable,

73
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.045
at any one time.

74
00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:49.440
Here, again, is
what is contained.

75
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.615
We have our bootstrap code.

76
00:03:51.615 --> 00:03:56.685
At offset 1B8 we have our
Windows disk signature.

77
00:03:56.685 --> 00:04:00.900
We have our partition indicator,

78
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.860
whether it's active
bootable or not bootable.

79
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.975
That's going to be
one byte in length.

80
00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:10.340
Like we saw it before, it'll
either be a hexadecimal 80,

81
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.485
or a hexadecimal 00.

82
00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:15.110
80 means it is bootable,

83
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.650
00 means it is not.

84
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.360
We have our legacy cylinder
head sector addressing.

85
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.035
Then at offset 1C2,

86
00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:28.110
we have our partition
type indicator.

87
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.050
This will tell you if it's
a GUID partition table,

88
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.440
or if it's an extended
partition, NTFS, or FAT.

89
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.585
That is one byte in length.

90
00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:39.465
Then our next three
bytes will be,

91
00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:44.740
again, legacy cylinder
head sector addressing.

92
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.850
That's three bytes.

93
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.225
The next four bytes will tell us

94
00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.910
the first sector
in the partition.

95
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.590
That is four bytes long,

96
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.120
and that is located right here.

97
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.770
Then this will be the size
of the partition in sectors,

98
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.400
right here, these four bytes.

99
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.290
If we wanted to get
the size in bytes,

100
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.480
we would multiply the number

101
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.490
of sectors times 512

102
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.770
to give us the total
number of bytes.

103
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.935
We have our active
bootable and we have

104
00:05:25.935 --> 00:05:29.265
our cylinder-head-sector
partition type

105
00:05:29.265 --> 00:05:31.215
right here. This 0C.

106
00:05:31.215 --> 00:05:33.930
Again, like a C
cylinder-head-sector address

107
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.430
which you don't need
to worry about.

108
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.670
The first sector, where
the petition starts,

109
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.355
the location, and the size
of the partition in sectors.

110
00:05:47.355 --> 00:05:51.040
These are some common
partition types.

111
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.090
If you saw hexadecimal 04 that
would represent a FAT 16.

112
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.020
This would be 05 would be
DOS extended partition.

113
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.560
NTFS is usually
represented as 07.

114
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.730
FAT 32, you can see a 0B or 0C,

115
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.955
and 0F would be in
extended partition,

116
00:06:17.955 --> 00:06:23.530
083 would represent
a Linux partition.

117
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.870
The extended logical partition.

118
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.460
Since we can only have

119
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.940
four entries to
give us the ability

120
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.845
to have more than four
partitions on a single drive,

121
00:06:37.845 --> 00:06:41.205
we have what's called the
extended logical partition.

122
00:06:41.205 --> 00:06:45.580
You can see that's right
here, outlined in green.

123
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.695
In an extended logical partition,

124
00:06:49.695 --> 00:06:52.395
you'll have a partition table

125
00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:56.100
at the beginning of the
extended logical partition,

126
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.310
and at the end before
the second one,

127
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.475
you have another partition
table indicating

128
00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:03.690
where the start of the next

129
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.670
extended logical partition is.

130
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.890
Physical sector 0 of the
extended logical partition.

131
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.155
You have a partition table

132
00:07:13.155 --> 00:07:16.725
that will point to
the next partition.

133
00:07:16.725 --> 00:07:18.435
It'll point the first entry.

134
00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:21.420
It will always have two
entries and only two entries.

135
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.200
The first entry is going
to point to itself.

136
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.850
The second entry in

137
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.620
that partition table
is going to point

138
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.910
to the next logical partition.

139
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.715
When you go there, you're going
to find a partition table

140
00:07:35.715 --> 00:07:38.955
and it will have two entries,

141
00:07:38.955 --> 00:07:42.030
if there's more than one ELP

142
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.070
left extended logical partition.

143
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.690
If there's just one entry,

144
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.040
it'll point to itself.

145
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.170
If there was a second entry here,

146
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.425
it'll point to the next
extended logical partition.

147
00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:54.780
The first entry points to itself,

148
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.430
and the second entry points to

149
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.175
the next extended
logical partition.

150
00:07:59.175 --> 00:08:02.445
We'll see that when we go
through our walk-through.

151
00:08:02.445 --> 00:08:04.785
This is an example of

152
00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:08.655
a partition table for an
extended logical partition.

153
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.805
It'll only have two entries.

154
00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:14.700
The first entry, would be

155
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:22.080
the location of itself
where it actually starts,

156
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.495
where its volume boot
record is located.

157
00:08:24.495 --> 00:08:27.015
In the next entry,

158
00:08:27.015 --> 00:08:29.865
this will tell you
where the start

159
00:08:29.865 --> 00:08:32.940
of the next logical
partition table is.

160
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.505
Again, this will
give you the size

161
00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:38.490
and it also has the
type indicator.

162
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.795
This is the second logical
partition table entry.

163
00:08:42.795 --> 00:08:45.720
You can see it only has one entry

164
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.670
because it's the last extended

165
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.620
logical partition in this case.

166
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.315
It points to itself.

167
00:08:51.315 --> 00:08:53.730
It gives you the partition
type indicator here,

168
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.175
we can see the 0C
outlined in green,

169
00:08:56.175 --> 00:09:01.380
and the size, how big the
partition is in sectors.

170
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.005
You would read this
partition table,

171
00:09:04.005 --> 00:09:05.790
the exact same way you would read

172
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.250
the partition table located
in the master boot record.

173
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.055
Now we're going to go ahead
and do our walk-through.

174
00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:15.930
You need to download the

175
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.000
MBR VHD if you
haven't already done

176
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.770
so from the class drive.

177
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.415
Then we're going to have to
open Active Disk Editor,

178
00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:28.500
like we did before when we did

179
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.970
our Active Disk Editor
demo. Let's do that.

180
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.470
Active Disk Editor.

181
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.130
Once we get to our start screen,

182
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.230
we're going to open a disk,

183
00:09:49.730 --> 00:10:00.130
navigate to where you
downloaded your MBR VHD,

184
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.950
and we're going to open the VHD.

185
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.995
You must mount the VHD
before you can open it.

186
00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:18.555
If you haven't done that,

187
00:10:18.555 --> 00:10:21.615
you're going to go into
your Disk Management,

188
00:10:21.615 --> 00:10:24.940
you're going to go to Actions.

189
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:35.185
Attach VHD, navigate to
where you saved your VHD,

190
00:10:35.185 --> 00:10:39.770
select it, and then click "Open."

191
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.900
Once you've done that, select it.

192
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.060
Note the drive number.

193
00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.145
Once you have that mounted,

194
00:10:54.145 --> 00:10:58.255
make sure you note the
drive number that it is,

195
00:10:58.255 --> 00:11:01.460
so when you go to mounted
it makes it easier.

196
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.450
Once you've done that,

197
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.840
go ahead and select
it, and click "Open."

198
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.620
Your drive will open.

199
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.170
Now, this is our
master boot record.

200
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.220
Make sure that your template is

201
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.275
set on master boot record.

202
00:11:23.275 --> 00:11:25.780
Remember the template drop-down.

203
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.240
We want to be on
master boot record.

204
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.550
We can see here all the stuff

205
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.650
that's in our master boot record.

206
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.900
We have our boot code.

207
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:47.890
We have our disk
serial number, at 1B8.

208
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.720
It should be right here.

209
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.420
That's our disk serial number.

210
00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.620
Then we have the start
of our partition table.

211
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.340
This is the active flag.

212
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.525
In mine right now is 00,

213
00:12:07.525 --> 00:12:10.400
so it is not bootable.

214
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.165
After the active flag,

215
00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:17.950
we have our cylinder
head sector addressing,

216
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.780
which we said was our legacy

217
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.375
addressing that we
don't use anymore.

218
00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:26.649
Then we have our
partition type indicator,

219
00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:28.300
which will tell us what type of

220
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.225
file system is on this disk.

221
00:12:31.225 --> 00:12:34.580
This was a 0c.

222
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.600
Then we have our, again,

223
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.460
cylinder head sector addressing.

224
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.830
We have the location
of the first sector.

225
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.580
It says the first
sector is sector 128.

226
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.625
Now we have our size,

227
00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:54.624
the size of this
particular partition,

228
00:12:54.624 --> 00:12:57.460
the number of sectors
in the partition.

229
00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.490
If we wanted to get the
sector size in bytes,

230
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.605
we would multiply that number,

231
00:13:02.605 --> 00:13:09.055
that 204,800 times 512,

232
00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:10.870
which is our sector size,

233
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.650
which would give us our
total bytes per sector.

234
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.124
Second entry.

235
00:13:20.124 --> 00:13:22.270
We read the same way.

236
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.645
First is our boot indicator,

237
00:13:25.645 --> 00:13:33.025
followed by our cylinder
head sector addressing.

238
00:13:33.025 --> 00:13:36.385
Then we have our
partition type indicator,

239
00:13:36.385 --> 00:13:38.784
which in this case is 07,

240
00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:41.380
which would tell
us that it's NTFS.

241
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.300
Then we have our,

242
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.615
again, cylinder head
sector addressing.

243
00:13:46.615 --> 00:13:49.915
Then we have the location
of the first sector.

244
00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:53.290
The first for partition
2 in this disk,

245
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.085
is going to be 204,928,

246
00:13:57.085 --> 00:13:59.605
would be the location
of the first sector.

247
00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:04.610
Then we have the partition
size in sectors.

248
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.540
Then that size is going to
be, you can see it up here,

249
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:16.880
total sectors is
going to be 409,600.

250
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.140
Then we have our next partition.

251
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.300
Again, you have the
active bootable.

252
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.030
This is 00, so it
is not bootable.

253
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.035
If it weren't, hexadecimal
80 would be bootable.

254
00:14:32.035 --> 00:14:36.489
Then we have our cylinder
head sector addressing,

255
00:14:36.489 --> 00:14:41.350
a partition type, which is 0c.

256
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:48.325
0c is fact 32.

257
00:14:48.325 --> 00:14:52.880
Then we have our cylinder
head sector addressing.

258
00:14:53.580 --> 00:15:00.085
Then we have our location,

259
00:15:00.085 --> 00:15:03.470
the first sector
in our partition.

260
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.490
We can see. Then we

261
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.645
have our size of our
partition in sectors.

262
00:15:15.645 --> 00:15:18.435
We have the total
number of sectors.

263
00:15:18.435 --> 00:15:21.105
We have, in this one,

264
00:15:21.105 --> 00:15:23.920
the location of the first sector.

265
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.160
Now we have another partition,

266
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.125
because we have
four entries here.

267
00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:32.410
We can see its active flag,

268
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.740
again, is 00, so it
is not bootable.

269
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.300
We have our legacy
cylinder-head-sector

270
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:46.095
addressing and we have
our partition type,

271
00:15:46.095 --> 00:15:51.150
which is 05, which is a
DOS extended partition.

272
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:55.019
We know our fourth partition
is an extended partition.

273
00:15:55.019 --> 00:16:00.059
We have our cylinder-head-sector
addressing,

274
00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:02.250
which we no longer use,

275
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:03.690
but it is still there.

276
00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.930
Then we have the location
of our first sector,

277
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.700
which in this case,

278
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.474
the first sector of our
extended logical partition,

279
00:16:11.474 --> 00:16:24.615
is going to be sector 1,024,128.

280
00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:26.760
Now what's important
to know about

281
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.100
this is this is giving us

282
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.900
the address relative to

283
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.170
the start of the
physical drive itself.

284
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.360
Now where things start and

285
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.950
what their relative to is going

286
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:41.730
to be very important
throughout this this path.

287
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.400
This location is
relative to the start of

288
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.370
the disk itself,
the physical disk.

289
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:51.235
Then we have the size in sectors,

290
00:16:51.235 --> 00:16:53.135
the total number of sectors.

291
00:16:53.135 --> 00:16:54.920
To get the total size,

292
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.430
we would multiply that
number times 512,

293
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:59.705
which is our sector size,

294
00:16:59.705 --> 00:17:04.770
and that would give us our
total bytes in the partition.

295
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:10.000
Then we have our ending
55 AA as our signature.

296
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.980
Let's take a look at

297
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.630
the extended logical partition

298
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.670
and the partition
tables within it.

299
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.110
What we're going to do is,

300
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:23.500
we're going go to
''File,'' Open.''

301
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:28.540
Now, it's very important
we select the right thing.

302
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.910
You want to select the
full extended partition,

303
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.135
not the volume, and not
the ELPs below here.

304
00:17:36.135 --> 00:17:41.370
We want to select the
extended partition.

305
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.250
Select the extended partition.

306
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.235
Don't click on
anything over here.

307
00:17:47.235 --> 00:17:50.980
To the right, just
click ''Open.''

308
00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.190
Because we want to see the
entire extended partition.

309
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.410
We could see at the
very beginning in

310
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.975
sector 0 of our
extended partition,

311
00:18:00.975 --> 00:18:02.880
we see what looks like

312
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.550
a master boot record
with a partition table.

313
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.635
This is the partition table

314
00:18:07.635 --> 00:18:10.065
for the extended
logical partition,

315
00:18:10.065 --> 00:18:11.820
because each of these extended

316
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.700
logical partitions
has a table prior

317
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.890
to the volume boot record to tell

318
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.410
us the location of itself.

319
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.840
This first entry is
going to point to

320
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.025
the start of the partition
we're looking at.

321
00:18:26.025 --> 00:18:28.860
The second entry is
going to tell us where

322
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.055
the next extended logical
partition begins.

323
00:18:32.055 --> 00:18:35.280
You'd read this entry the
same as we did before.

324
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.140
It is not bootable,

325
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.760
but we know extended logical

326
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.815
partitions are never bootable.

327
00:18:40.815 --> 00:18:44.490
Then we have our
cylinder-head-sector addressing.

328
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.745
We have the partition
type, which is 0, 7,

329
00:18:47.745 --> 00:18:50.414
which tells us that
the first partition

330
00:18:50.414 --> 00:18:52.710
within this extended
logical partition

331
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.990
is going to be NTFS.

332
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.170
We have our cylinder-head-sector
addressing.

333
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.125
Then this partition
points to itself,

334
00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:04.755
and we can see the
first sector is 128.

335
00:19:04.755 --> 00:19:11.895
That number is relative to
the start of the partition,

336
00:19:11.895 --> 00:19:14.025
to the start of the volume,

337
00:19:14.025 --> 00:19:18.310
not to the start of
the physical disk.

338
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:24.330
Remember that because if not,

339
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.100
you'll be very lost
in the navigation.

340
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.380
So 128 is relative to
the start of the volume,

341
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.010
this particular partition within

342
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.035
the extended logical partition

343
00:19:37.035 --> 00:19:40.530
is where this location
is relative to.

344
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:44.475
Then we have the size
again total sectors.

345
00:19:44.475 --> 00:19:46.530
If we wanted to get
the size in bytes,

346
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.810
we multiply that times 512.

347
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.245
If I were to go
out to sector 128,

348
00:19:55.245 --> 00:19:58.635
I should see in NTFS
volume boot record.

349
00:19:58.635 --> 00:20:01.270
Let's test that theory.

350
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.200
You can either go from navigation

351
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.030
or straight to go to sector.

352
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:14.490
Make sure we type 128 in
the sector, not cluster.

353
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.234
You want to make sure
you typed in sector

354
00:20:20.234 --> 00:20:23.650
128 and we're going
to click ''Okay.''

355
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:30.460
What we find here is indeed
in NTFS volume boot record.

356
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.110
Let's use our back button.

357
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.970
This is one I think
I didn't show you,

358
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.010
but the Back button is
going to come in handy.

359
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.570
We'll hit the ''Back button''

360
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.325
and we're going right back to

361
00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:47.620
our partition table for our
extended logical partition.

362
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.720
It says the next extended
logical partition,

363
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:57.695
we're going to find
out at sector 204,928.

364
00:20:57.695 --> 00:21:01.585
You can go ahead and write
that down if you'd like,

365
00:21:01.585 --> 00:21:03.820
and we're going to navigate.

366
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.770
Go-to sector, make sure you're

367
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.935
typing in the sector,
not cluster box,

368
00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:18.235
and we're going to type in
the number 2, 0, 4, 928.

369
00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:20.905
What we should
expect to find here

370
00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:24.205
is again another partition table.

371
00:21:24.205 --> 00:21:26.740
We're going to click Okay.

372
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.070
You can see we see looks like

373
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.920
a partition table would
have 5, 5 a signature.

374
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.700
What we have to do here
is make sure you're

375
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.310
set to master boot record.

376
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:44.030
We're going to right-click
set template position.

377
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.130
We get our template for
our master boot record.

378
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.040
We can see the partition
table has two entries,

379
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.600
which is what it should have.

380
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.805
It will always have two entries.

381
00:21:54.805 --> 00:21:58.240
The first entry is going
to point to itself.

382
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.730
Not active bootable.

383
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.130
We have our cylinder head sector,

384
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.200
we have our partition
type indicator,

385
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.330
which again tells
us this one is also

386
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:14.365
NTFS 07, cylinder head sector.

387
00:22:14.365 --> 00:22:17.665
Now the first sector is 128.

388
00:22:17.665 --> 00:22:21.760
The first sector is always
going to be 128 from here,

389
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.335
because when it points to itself,

390
00:22:23.335 --> 00:22:28.430
it's always 128 sectors in
from the start of the volume.

391
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.855
Then we have the total
size in sectors.

392
00:22:34.855 --> 00:22:37.540
Now the second entry
is going to point to

393
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.790
the next extended
logical partition.

394
00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.940
Again, active bootable 00.

395
00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.250
We have cylinder head
sector addressing.

396
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.500
Our file system is 05,

397
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.025
which stands for extended
logical partition,

398
00:22:57.025 --> 00:22:59.470
extended DOS partition.

399
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.755
Then we have our cylinder
head sector addressing again,

400
00:23:02.755 --> 00:23:04.690
and we would have the location of

401
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.570
our next extended
logical partition,

402
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:11.350
which is out at 6,

403
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.575
1, 4, 6, 5, 6.

404
00:23:14.575 --> 00:23:19.870
Then we have the size
in sectors right here,

405
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.155
would be our size in sectors.

406
00:23:23.155 --> 00:23:29.530
Size and sectors is 450,688.

407
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.540
Again, if you wanted
to size in bytes,

408
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.915
you would multiply
that number times 512.

409
00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:38.470
Let's go ahead and go out and

410
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.410
see if we see

411
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.500
another partition table
out at this location,

412
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.920
6, 1, 4, 6, 5, 6.

413
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.335
Again, we'd go to,

414
00:23:50.335 --> 00:23:52.720
it can either go navigation,

415
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.370
go to sector, or you could
just click Go to sector.

416
00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.525
That number was 6, 1,

417
00:24:01.525 --> 00:24:08.410
4, 6, 5, 6.

418
00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.210
We click Okay.

419
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.440
We want to make sure
you're still on

420
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.665
master boot record as
far as your template.

421
00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:21.880
We're going to right-click
set template position,

422
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.745
and again we can see
our partition table.

423
00:24:24.745 --> 00:24:27.565
This time we see it
only has one entry.

424
00:24:27.565 --> 00:24:31.045
That tells us this is the last
extended logical partition

425
00:24:31.045 --> 00:24:33.145
on this physical drive,

426
00:24:33.145 --> 00:24:35.485
on just logical drive.

427
00:24:35.485 --> 00:24:38.905
It is not active bootable.

428
00:24:38.905 --> 00:24:42.069
We see our cylinder
head sector flags.

429
00:24:42.069 --> 00:24:43.300
We see the type.

430
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.545
The file system that is
actually on here is NTFS,

431
00:24:47.545 --> 00:24:50.290
cylinder head sector addressing,

432
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:53.125
and then we see the location
of the first sector.

433
00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:55.960
Again we see it's 128.

434
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.655
Like I said, it'll always be

435
00:24:57.655 --> 00:25:01.420
128 sectors in the
volume boot record.

436
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.225
The start of the partition
will be at 128 sectors

437
00:25:04.225 --> 00:25:08.420
in from the extended
logical partition table.

438
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.235
If we go ahead and navigate,

439
00:25:12.235 --> 00:25:14.785
or go to sector,

440
00:25:14.785 --> 00:25:18.890
and we type in 128,

441
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:24.870
and we click Okay we come to
our NTFS volume boot record.

442
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:29.760
What's important to remember
is these locations are

443
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.510
relative to the start
of the logical volume,

444
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.720
the logical partition
within the extended logical

445
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:43.990
partition not the physical drive.

446
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.870
Very important to remember that.

447
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:56.510
That is how you would read
a volume boot record.

448
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.329
The extended logical
partition tables

449
00:26:03.329 --> 00:26:08.049
located within an extended
logical partition.
