WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.444
Course A, the FAT file system

2
00:00:02.444 --> 00:00:04.620
or I'm module 2 and
in this module,

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.060
but we're going to talk about

4
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.680
the volume boot
record. Next slide.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.340
The FAT 32 volume boot record,

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.489
it's located in the first
sector of the volume,

7
00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.435
which is going to be
logical sectors 0.

8
00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:24.785
Now, don't confuse this

9
00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:26.915
with the first
sector of the disk,

10
00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:28.985
which is Physical sector 0.

11
00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:32.945
This is the first sector
of the logical volume.

12
00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:35.255
This file is going to contain

13
00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:38.615
information about the volume.

14
00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.300
Some of the information of

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.120
interest to us in the
volume boot record.

16
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.780
What we're going
to see the OEM ID,

17
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.540
which will most
likely be MS-DOS5.0.

18
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.570
This will be the volume ON

19
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.265
OEM MID for operating
systems, Windows 2009.

20
00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:09.190
Most likely that's the only
MID we're going to see.

21
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.025
We're going to be interested
in bytes per sector,

22
00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:14.365
which is usually going to be 512.

23
00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:17.515
We're usually going to have
512 bytes in a sector.

24
00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:20.815
We also need to know how many
sectors are in a cluster.

25
00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:22.570
This is going to
be very important

26
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.325
when we're navigating the disk.

27
00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:26.860
Sectors per cluster varies.

28
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.790
It can either be selected
by the operating system

29
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.170
or the user does have

30
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.780
the option to change
that if they would like.

31
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.025
We're going to see
the number of FATs.

32
00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:42.635
There should be two, one
is for backup purposes.

33
00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.650
We're going to see
hidden sectors.

34
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.050
These are sectors
proceeding the volume.

35
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.545
These are the sectors
on the physical drive

36
00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:55.175
that are in front of or
preceding the volume itself.

37
00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:57.915
We're going to see total sectors.

38
00:01:57.915 --> 00:02:00.760
Now, total sectors, times

39
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.170
sector signs will give us
the size of the volume.

40
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.510
We need to know how
big the volume is that

41
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.135
we're looking at. Next slide.

42
00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:13.345
This is more information
that we're going to look at

43
00:02:13.345 --> 00:02:16.375
in the FAT 32 volume boot record.

44
00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.445
We're going to look
at sectors per FAT,

45
00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:20.695
how many sectors are in each FAT?

46
00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:23.780
We want to know the
starting cluster

47
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.250
of the root directory because

48
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.905
the root directory is going to be

49
00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:29.690
a very important part of

50
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.300
the FAT file system that
we need to look at.

51
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.105
That's usually going
to be clustered too.

52
00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:36.650
We also want to know where

53
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.425
the backup boot
sector is located.

54
00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:43.595
The backup boot sector will
usually be in cluster 6.

55
00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:46.700
We're going to want to know
the volume serial number

56
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.100
because most likely you're
going to be looking at

57
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.500
FAT on removable media
and we're going to need

58
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.690
the volume serial number to track

59
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.855
that drive across volumes.

60
00:02:56.855 --> 00:02:59.390
We're also going to be
interested in the volume name,

61
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.910
note the volume name in

62
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.420
the boot record is not going to

63
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.475
be the user-created volume name

64
00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:09.515
that's going to be in
the root directory.

65
00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:13.565
It'll usually say no name
in the volume boot record.

66
00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:16.295
We're going to want to
know the file system type.

67
00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:19.295
That's also information
in the boot record.

68
00:03:19.295 --> 00:03:21.020
Now, do not confuse

69
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.995
the volume boot record with
the master boot record.

70
00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:26.090
The master boot record relates to

71
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.420
the physical dense and
volume boot record relates

72
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.345
to the logical
volume. Next slide.

73
00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:36.810
We can see here in the chart,

74
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.870
all the important information we

75
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.820
just talked about in the chart

76
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.220
shows us the offsets where we
can find that information.

77
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.674
These offsets are relative

78
00:03:47.674 --> 00:03:49.535
to the start of the
Data Structure.

79
00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:51.950
If we're looking at the
volume boot record,

80
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.870
the offsets you see,

81
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.850
they're relative to the start
of a volume boot record,

82
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.285
not the start of
the physical drive.

83
00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:02.340
Just keep that in mind.

84
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.950
The start of the Data Structure.

85
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.440
Next slide. This is

86
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.530
a look at a FAT 32
volume book record.

87
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.930
This is what it's
going to look like.

88
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.675
We'll look at it with our tools.

89
00:04:14.675 --> 00:04:18.020
It's located on logical sector

90
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.005
0 and these values

91
00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:24.590
are going to be
interpreted little-endian.

92
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.895
The volume boot record is going
to be one sector in size,

93
00:04:28.895 --> 00:04:32.980
it's 512 bytes, one
sector. Next slide.

94
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.025
Now we're going to do a
walk-through and take a look

95
00:04:37.025 --> 00:04:41.680
at the volume boot record
with active disk editor.

96
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.715
I need you to please
attach your MBR underscore

97
00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:51.515
VHD virtual hard drive
and remember to note

98
00:04:51.515 --> 00:04:54.800
the disk number of

99
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.270
their VHD in the volume letters

100
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.325
assign to your
virtual hard drive.

101
00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:05.345
I'm also going to need you
to open active disk editor.

102
00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:11.490
The first thing we need to
do is attach our MDR VHD.

103
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.935
We're going to go to
do disk management.

104
00:05:14.935 --> 00:05:17.384
Once you're in disk management,

105
00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:22.640
we're going to go to
Actions. Attach VHD.

106
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:29.060
We're going to browse to
where we saved our MBR VHD.

107
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.470
Mine is on my desktop in a
folder called Class VHD.

108
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.460
We're going to
select the MBR VHD.

109
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.160
We're going to click Open.

110
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:48.700
We're going to click Okay
and the VHD will attach.

111
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.780
Once you've attached the VHD,

112
00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:00.440
note the disk number and
the logical volume letters.

113
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.860
Next we're going to open
active disk editor.

114
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.500
Once active disk editors open,

115
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.600
locate the physical
disk, expand it.

116
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.105
We're going to select

117
00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:30.090
FAT 32 A is the volume that
we're going to look at.

118
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:35.265
So right-click open
and disk editor.

119
00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:37.830
Once it opens, it
should open right

120
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.785
to your volume boot record.

121
00:06:40.785 --> 00:06:43.110
Because it's logical
sector zero and we're

122
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.390
looking at the
logical drive if it

123
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.860
doesn't simply go to navigate
and go to boot sector zero.

124
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.030
Once you've done that, we're

125
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.290
going to take a look at some of

126
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.920
the information we went
over in our slides.

127
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.845
We have the OMED,

128
00:07:04.845 --> 00:07:10.030
which we expect is MSDOS5.0.

129
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:23.200
You can see that it's
located at offset 03.

130
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.600
Next, we have our
bytes per sector.

131
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.810
Now remember these values
are red little endian.

132
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.390
It'll be read from left to right.

133
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.245
If we take a look down
and our data interpreter,

134
00:07:43.245 --> 00:07:48.675
we can see the 16 bit
unsigned value is 512.

135
00:07:48.675 --> 00:07:52.410
Our bytes per sector are 512.

136
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.560
If we look up, we can see

137
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.560
that is what our
tool is telling us.

138
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.960
We have 512 bytes per sector.

139
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.870
Next we're going to look
at sectors per cluster.

140
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.500
We can see that it's two.

141
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.635
We have two sectors per cluster.

142
00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:18.250
So our clusters will
be 1024 in size.

143
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.590
You can see the number
of FATs is two,

144
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.990
which is what we'd expect to see.

145
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.740
That's located at
offset hexidecimal 10.

146
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.825
We can see we have
a media descriptor,

147
00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:42.765
and our media descriptor is F8.

148
00:08:42.765 --> 00:08:47.140
F8 indicates fixed disk.

149
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.850
We can see we have
hidden sectors,

150
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.460
which these are the sectors
proceeding the volume.

151
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.650
The sectors before
the logical volume

152
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.645
that are on the physical disk.

153
00:09:03.645 --> 00:09:07.390
Again, this value is
red little endian.

154
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:12.030
We can see that we
have a 128 sectors

155
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.080
proceeding the volume.

156
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:21.370
Total sectors, the next
value we want to look at.

157
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.130
This tells us how many total
sectors are on the volume,

158
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:38.055
and this is a 32 bit value.

159
00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:41.310
If we look at our data
interpreter and we

160
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.625
look at the unsigned
32-bit value,

161
00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:52.320
we have 204,800 sectors.

162
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.780
That is what our
tool is reporting.

163
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.650
If we multiply the
total number of

164
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.160
sectors times the sector size,

165
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.315
that will account for all
of the data on the volume.

166
00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:07.710
We're doing an exam,

167
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.045
we want to be able to account for

168
00:10:09.045 --> 00:10:11.590
all the data on the volume.

169
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:18.310
We can also see
sectors per FAT 769,

170
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.530
and that would be located
right here in the hex,

171
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.840
and again it's red little endian.

172
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:33.490
Our root cluster is cluster 2.

173
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:39.700
We can see that in the hex
root cluster, cluster 2,

174
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:52.800
backup boot sector, it
offset hexadecimal 32.

175
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.410
Again, we're navigating from

176
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.615
the start of the
volume boot record,

177
00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.420
not the start at
the physical desk.

178
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:07.540
We can see our backup boot
sector is located in Sector 6.

179
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:18.720
We can see our volume
serial number is

180
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:26.650
located at offset hexadecimal 43.

181
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.770
That's our volume serial number.

182
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.860
Now considering that in
this case we do have

183
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.540
a fixed disk because we

184
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.550
have attached to
virtual hard drive.

185
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.190
But if we were using
a thumb drive,

186
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.200
a volume serial number would be

187
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.240
important to track the use of

188
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.390
that USB device on this system

189
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.640
and also on other systems

190
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.110
that it may have
been plugged into.

191
00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.020
You see our volume
label is no name,

192
00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.230
which is what we expect to see
in the volume boot record.

193
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.005
If there was a
user-created volume label

194
00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:05.969
that would be in
the root directory.

195
00:12:05.969 --> 00:12:07.710
We're going to take a look
at the root directory

196
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.850
in our next module.

197
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.210
We can also see our
file system type.

198
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.790
Our file system is FAT 32,

199
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.595
and down at the
end of the sector,

200
00:12:25.595 --> 00:12:31.550
we have our boot sector
signature as 55 AA,

201
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.140
which is what we expect to see.

202
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:40.400
That is all the important
information contained in

203
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.390
the FAT 32 volume boot record.
