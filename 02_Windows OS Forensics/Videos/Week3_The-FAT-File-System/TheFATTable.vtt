WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.600
We are talking about the Fat file
system here in course eight And

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.535
in module before we're going to talk
about the file allocation table,

3
00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:13.661
we're going to take a look at
how it works and how we read it.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.340
The facts of the file
allocation table is the call.

5
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.686
What they do is they track cluster
allocation which clusters are in use being

6
00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:30.040
occupied by a file and which clusters are
not in use and available to be written to?

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.540
Yeah.

8
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.551
File allocation table has an entry for
every cluster on the volume.

9
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.825
Fat one and fat too should be the same
because Fat too is a backup for

10
00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:48.540
recovery purposes.

11
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.314
If that one becomes corrupted,

12
00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:56.461
they are located in the system
area on all versions of that.

13
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.001
And again, they're used to track
cluster allocation status,

14
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:08.829
whether the cluster is
being occupied by a file or

15
00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:14.129
it's available to be written
to each of these entries

16
00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:19.193
which represents a cluster
on the drive will give us

17
00:01:19.193 --> 00:01:24.256
the location of the next
cluster of that file here is

18
00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:29.491
kind of a visual example of
what the facts do we have?

19
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:33.917
Our system area and our fats

20
00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:38.920
are in the system area now out in

21
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.116
the data area we have our files,

22
00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:49.511
we have a file here just written.

23
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:54.618
And cluster too, cluster two Points to

24
00:01:54.618 --> 00:02:00.661
cluster six where the rest
of this file lives.

25
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.240
So this file is what we call fragmented.

26
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.139
Yeah.

27
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.861
In other words it's not
right next to each other.

28
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.140
Part of it is in cluster too.

29
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.361
And then the other part
of it is in cluster six.

30
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.195
If we look at cluster three,
Cluster three points us to

31
00:02:24.195 --> 00:02:29.361
cluster four and
then we have an end of file marker E o f.

32
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.611
This would be called a contiguous
file Because cluster

33
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:37.940
three is right next to cluster four.

34
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.970
And then looking at our diagram and
cluster five, we just have an end

35
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.530
of file marker which this tells me that
the file occupying Cluster five only

36
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.851
needs one cluster so it's not big
enough to need more than one cluster.

37
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.761
A fat writes the data to
the first available cluster.

38
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.844
So if we deleted one of these and

39
00:03:02.844 --> 00:03:07.551
wrote a new file it could
go into this empty space.

40
00:03:07.551 --> 00:03:13.117
Now we're going to see Type three
Types of entries in the fat,

41
00:03:13.117 --> 00:03:18.573
you're going to see this marker,
a first offense offense or

42
00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:23.024
less and
that indicates end of file that tells us

43
00:03:23.024 --> 00:03:27.142
we're either at the end
of a cluster chain or

44
00:03:27.142 --> 00:03:32.708
if it's only occupies one cluster
will just see that marker

45
00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:37.861
in the cluster that represents
that file on the draft.

46
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.540
You could see 000000.

47
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.772
And this indicates that
the cluster is not being used,

48
00:03:46.772 --> 00:03:49.440
it's available to be written to or

49
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.592
we'll see a pointer to the next
cluster And down here we can see this

50
00:03:54.592 --> 00:04:00.540
is what a fat table is going to look
like when we view it with our tools.

51
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.240
This F A f f f f Os.

52
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.241
This is what we call a media descriptor
generally indicates fixed disk but

53
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:16.010
it's what we call a media descriptor.

54
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.520
These next four bites Tell us
the version of Fat one looking at and

55
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.861
since they were all maxed out at ff ff
ff We know we're looking at Fat 32.

56
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.240
Fat 32 has four byte entries.

57
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.354
Fat 12 and 16 Have to bite entries for
each cluster but

58
00:04:37.354 --> 00:04:43.361
we are going to focus on fat 32 because
that's most likely what we'll see today.

59
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.601
So four Byte entries.

60
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.790
These next four bites represent
cluster two because our cluster

61
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.751
numbering out on our drives
is going to start it too.

62
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.011
So this represents cluster too and
it's pointing to would have

63
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:08.370
to translate that number but
it's pointing to another cost around

64
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.110
in the drive this would be the Filed
clustered 3's representation and

65
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.084
cluster to re has an end of file
marker which means the file that

66
00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:23.581
is occupying cluster three
only takes up one cluster And

67
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:29.940
we had the four bytes for close to four
and we have an end of file marker.

68
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.240
Cluster five we have
an entire file marker.

69
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.061
Now we look at cluster six Cluster
six points to cluster seven.

70
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.653
If we look at the four bytes that
represent cluster seven in our fat table,

71
00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:49.040
They pointed to cluster eight 9 10.

72
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.240
It just goes you can see this
is a long continuous file.

73
00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:01.761
Yes this is showing us what
we have in our fat tables.

74
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.884
It's the same fat table we looked at
in the previous slide we have our media

75
00:06:07.884 --> 00:06:11.251
descriptor for bites,
then we have our fat type.

76
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.161
Then this The next four bytes
represents cluster too.

77
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.700
And cluster two points
out to cluster 42656.

78
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.236
If we translated and
these are red the Lindy in again,

79
00:06:30.236 --> 00:06:37.640
If we translated 0000 86 Ao
would come up with 42,665.

80
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.640
So that's what cluster to cluster to.

81
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.751
Points to that cluster.

82
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:50.404
Now if we look at cluster three,
Hesitant to file marker close to 400 and

83
00:06:50.404 --> 00:06:56.340
a file marker five And
then cluster six Points to cluster seven.

84
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:02.920
We look at the entry for cluster seven It
points to eight Mr eight points to nine.

85
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.911
And this file just goes
on to the very end.

86
00:07:05.911 --> 00:07:11.261
We have clustered 20 down
here Pointing to cluster 21.

87
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.561
So that would be how we
would look at our fat table.

88
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.290
We're going to do a walk through and
take a look at this on disk.

89
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:26.194
So please attach your NPR Bhd
note that this number of your

90
00:07:26.194 --> 00:07:32.140
attached virtual hard drive so
we can locate it.

91
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.970
And please open up active disk editor for
our walk through.

92
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.821
The first thing we're going
to do is attach R V H.

93
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:42.340
D.

94
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:49.740
So we'd go to actions,
attach PhD would navigate out.

95
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.431
Find R M B R V H.

96
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:51.931
D.

97
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.311
Mhm click open and it will attach the V H.

98
00:07:58.311 --> 00:07:59.740
D.
For us.

99
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.850
Yeah.

100
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:01.740
Yeah.

101
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.240
Once we've done that, mm hmm.

102
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.251
We can see R V H.

103
00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:07.500
D.

104
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.051
Remember the drive number.

105
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.040
Mhm.

106
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.940
Now we're going to open
Active disk editor.

107
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.640
Mhm.

108
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:23.070
Once Active disk editor opens,
we're going to open a logical volume,

109
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:28.855
again the same logical volume we did for
our last walk through and

110
00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:36.740
we're going to take a look at the fat file
table and see how our tool shows it to us.

111
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.251
Yes.

112
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.200
And I'm going to show you
an easier way to read it.

113
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.661
So we're going to select open disk.

114
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.940
Mhm.

115
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:52.420
We're going to select volumes because
we want to look at the volume,

116
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.861
not a physical disk.

117
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.370
And we are going to
select our fat 32 volume.

118
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.840
That is 200 MB in size.

119
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:08.240
My name is Dr S and
we're going to open it.

120
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.640
Okay.

121
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.440
Yeah.

122
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:16.740
Again when it opens by default this tool
will take you to the volume boot record.

123
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.340
Mhm.

124
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.255
We've already taken a look at this so

125
00:09:21.255 --> 00:09:26.181
we know how many sectors
we have per cluster And

126
00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:34.240
just in case it's four sectors per
cluster In 512 bytes per sector.

127
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.267
Yeah, now we're going to go
up to the navigate button and

128
00:09:39.267 --> 00:09:44.084
we're going to navigate to Fat one and
we look at this,

129
00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.702
it's a little hard to read But

130
00:09:46.702 --> 00:09:52.340
we know each one of our entries
is four bytes in length.

131
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:58.981
So what we're going to do is we're
going to go to file mhm Preferences and

132
00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:05.388
we're going to change our view in
bytes per line from 16 to 4 and

133
00:10:05.388 --> 00:10:10.283
we're going to click OK once
that opens up it makes it

134
00:10:10.283 --> 00:10:14.961
a little bit easier for
us to read our fat table.

135
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.661
The first entry at our fat table is
going to be the media descriptor.

136
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.240
Mhm.

137
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:32.440
And we have F a f f f f o f and
this usually indicates a fixed disk.

138
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.694
Our next entry, our next four byte
entry in our fat table is going to tell

139
00:10:37.694 --> 00:10:43.440
us what version of fat we're looking
at and we can see we have ff ff ff ff.

140
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.461
So we know we're looking at Fat 32.

141
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:54.420
This next entry down here represents
cluster too because cluster

142
00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.020
numbering starts at two out on the volume,
so cluster too,

143
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:06.750
Cluster two in this particular fat
table has an end of file marker in it.

144
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.540
That means that the file occupying
cluster to only needs one cluster.

145
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.700
We looked down,
we see our entry for cluster three.

146
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:21.117
This entry represents cluster three,
it's telling us its allocation status,

147
00:11:21.117 --> 00:11:26.151
it's telling us it is allocated and
it doesn't point to another cluster.

148
00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:31.440
So we know that the file and
cluster three only takes up one cluster.

149
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.990
We look at the Representation for
Cluster four.

150
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.872
We see the same thing,

151
00:11:37.872 --> 00:11:42.726
we look at the entry for cluster five,

152
00:11:42.726 --> 00:11:49.270
we see the same thing 6789 10, 11, 12.

153
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:56.040
Now, when we look at the entry for
cluster 13.

154
00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.840
Mhm And we highlight it little indian.

155
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.117
Yeah, We can see that the entry for

156
00:12:05.117 --> 00:12:10.541
cluster 13 these four bytes
represent close to 13 and

157
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:16.756
they have a pointer in them and
that pointer is telling us to go to,

158
00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:23.536
we look at our data interpreter,
cluster 14, we look at the entry for

159
00:12:23.536 --> 00:12:29.140
cluster 14 and
that's pointing us to cluster 15.

160
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.580
Mhm.

161
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.111
We could see it.

162
00:12:31.111 --> 00:12:32.541
Our data interpreter or zero.

163
00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:33.761
f is 15.

164
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:43.156
So we look at the representation
the entry in our Table for

165
00:12:43.156 --> 00:12:48.651
cluster 15 And it points to cluster 16.

166
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:54.281
We look at the fat table entry for

167
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:58.283
cluster 16 right below and

168
00:12:58.283 --> 00:13:03.140
it points us to cluster 17.

169
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:08.223
So we look at the entry for cluster 17 And

170
00:13:08.223 --> 00:13:12.440
it points us to cluster 18.

171
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.522
And when we look at the four
Byte fat table entry For

172
00:13:17.522 --> 00:13:22.440
cluster 18 we see an end of file marker.

173
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.540
Mm hmm.

174
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.940
The company people.

175
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.251
Yeah, if we continue down the table.

176
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.580
Mhm.

177
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.940
We can see that.

178
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.740
Yeah.

179
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.251
Mhm.

180
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.380
Cluster 19 also has an end
of file marker in it.

181
00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.171
Cluster 20 has an end
of file marker in it.

182
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.060
Yeah.

183
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.540
We look at the Fat Table entry for
Claim 21.

184
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.894
We can see all zeros and
we know that all zeros

185
00:13:53.894 --> 00:13:58.891
means that the clusters are marked
as available to be written to.

186
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.840
Mhm.

187
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.840
Know that.

188
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.188
To see a cluster in the middle of
the table marked is available to be

189
00:14:09.188 --> 00:14:14.840
written to maybe an indication
that a file was deleted there.

190
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.340
Mhm.

191
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:22.028
If we look down in our fat table,
we see more into file markers and

192
00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:26.166
we see more files that
are contiguous meaning that

193
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:29.840
the clusters are one
right after the other.

194
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.791
They're not fragmented but we're not
jumping from one cluster to another.

195
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.440
And that would be how we would
take a look at our fat table.

196
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:42.940
Yeah.
