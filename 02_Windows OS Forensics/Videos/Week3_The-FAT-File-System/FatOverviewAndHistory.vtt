Course 8.

2
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.440
We're going to talk about
the FAT file system.

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.558
Next slide.

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.170
An overview of what this
course is going to cover.

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.240
We're going to talk about the history and
versions of FAT.

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.159
We're going to talk about the data
structures that make up the FAT file

7
00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:27.161
system, things like the root directory and
the volume boot record.

8
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.730
We're also going to talk about
the directory structure within the FAT

9
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.940
file system.

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.740
We're going to talk about file and
directory creation and deletion.

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.140
What happens when we create a file?

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.840
What happens when we delete it?

13
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.568
What occurs when we create a directory?

14
00:00:43.568 --> 00:00:46.540
And what happens when we
delete that directory?

15
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.582
We're also going to talk about recovering
data in the FAT file system and

16
00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:54.670
some of the limitations of data recovery.

17
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.572
Next slide.

18
00:01:00.547 --> 00:01:03.223
Course 8, Module 1.

19
00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:09.684
We're going to talk about an overview
of the FAT file system and its history.

20
00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:10.810
Next slide.

21
00:01:13.704 --> 00:01:18.833
Let's start out by defining
what a file system is.

22
00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:23.765
A file system is a method of reading,
writing, tracking,

23
00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:26.636
and recovering data from a drive.

24
00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:31.050
Your file system tracks the location
of the data on your drive so

25
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.540
it knows where all your files,
folders, and applications are.

26
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.945
So when we double click on a file or
an application,

27
00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:43.681
the file system knows where
to go to retrieve that data.

28
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:49.776
It also tracks which clusters are in use,
being occupied by a file.

29
00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:53.652
And which clusters are available for

30
00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:58.784
us to write a file to, or
save an application to.

31
00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.096
Next slide.

32
00:02:02.804 --> 00:02:06.140
The history of the FAT file system.

33
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.881
When we started out with FAT12,
which was 2 to the 12th power of bits,

34
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:15.084
that's how many bits we had to work with.

35
00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:22.727
Which gave us 4,096 maximum clusters for
the volume.

36
00:02:22.727 --> 00:02:28.201
So we can only have 4,096
clusters on a FAT12 volume.

37
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:35.370
Now FAT16 which was 2 to the 16th
power of bits to work with.

38
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.240
And this gave us 65,536 maximum
clusters for the volume.

39
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.632
So it's better but

40
00:02:43.632 --> 00:02:48.243
it's still not something you're
going to see very often today.

41
00:02:48.243 --> 00:02:50.710
Considering the size of drives,

42
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.640
these file systems really
are not going to be applicable.

43
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.632
Next slide.

44
00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:02.997
The next version of FAT we see
in the evolution is FAT32.

45
00:03:02.997 --> 00:03:08.416
Now FAT32 you will see
today on removable media,

46
00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:12.827
and it is possible to
format a partition on

47
00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:17.879
an internal drive on
a Windows system FAT32.

48
00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.590
FAT32 uses 28 bits not 32,

49
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.792
4 bits are reserved.

50
00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:32.252
So it's 2 to the 28th power of
bits that we have to work with.

51
00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:37.783
Which gives us 268,435,456

52
00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:45.272
maximum clusters that we
can have on a FAT32 volume.

53
00:03:45.272 --> 00:03:48.061
Now that's quite a bit more
than we had with FAT16.

54
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.061
The latest version of FAT is ExFAT.

55
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:58.732
An ExFAT does use all 32 bits, so
we have 32 bits to work with in ExFAT.

56
00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:02.821
Which is 2 to the 32nd power.

57
00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:07.566
And you can see the number on
the slide of maximum clusters it is

58
00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:10.130
quite a bit larger than FAT32.

59
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.676
And we are going to have a whole
section on ExFAT throughout this path.

60
00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:16.442
Next slide.

61
00:04:19.424 --> 00:04:24.461
The FAT file system overview, well we
have a system area and a data area.

62
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.298
Now in FAT12 and 16,
the system area which comprised of

63
00:04:30.298 --> 00:04:34.998
the volume boot records, FAT1 and
2, and the root directory.

64
00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:40.061
And then we had our files and
folders saved out in the data area.

65
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.284
Now because the root directory was
in the system area on FAT12 and

66
00:04:46.284 --> 00:04:49.431
16, the size was limited to one cluster.

67
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:55.574
So we only had one cluster to work with
when we were addressing our files.

68
00:04:55.574 --> 00:04:58.761
So that did cause some issues.

69
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.540
So we went to FAT32.

70
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:10.240
Now in FAT32, the volume boot record is
in the system area and so is FAT1 and 2.

71
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.478
But the root directory in FAT32
was moved out to the data area to

72
00:05:15.478 --> 00:05:21.395
allow the root directory to expand
beyond that one cluster limitation,

73
00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:27.801
allowing us to write a lot more files,
folders, directories to our volumes.

74
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.679
In our next module, we're going to talk
about the FAT volume boot record and

75
00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:42.161
see the important information
that is contained in that record.
