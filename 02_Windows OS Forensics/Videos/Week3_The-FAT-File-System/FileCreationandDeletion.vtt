1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.940
Were looking at the Fat file
system in course eight.

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.593
And in this module,

3
00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:12.740
module five we're going to look at
fat file creation and deletion.

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.677
What happens when we create a file and

5
00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:20.340
what happens when we don't
need it the creation process?

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.490
What happens when files created
on our fat file system?

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.704
Well a directory entry is written
in the parent directory and

8
00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:33.310
we looked at our directory entries are
short file name and our long final name.

9
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.415
Directory entries in our last module, so

10
00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:41.061
that directory entry gets written.

11
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.340
The data is written to
the first available clusters.

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.140
So the data is going to get written out
on the drive and entries are made in

13
00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.740
the fat the file allocation table to show
the chain of clusters used by the file.

14
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.607
And if it only uses one cluster we'll have
that end of file marker like we saw in our

15
00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.640
previous module.

16
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.140
What happens when we delete a file,
the file system?

17
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.708
Well the first character of
the directory entry set is

18
00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:19.040
changed to a hexi decimal E five.

19
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.290
And this indicates the file
system that the file is deleted.

20
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.740
So it just skips it,
the clusters in the fat are zeroed out.

21
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.806
What this means is those
fat directory entries,

22
00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:39.661
those fat table entries that we saw in our
previous module would be all zeroed out.

23
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.307
So we would not be able
to look at the fat and

24
00:01:44.307 --> 00:01:50.181
see that the cluster was occupied from
the fats point of view would be all zeros,

25
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:54.145
and that cluster would be
available to be written to.

26
00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:58.640
The data that's out on
the drive remains unchanged.

27
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.247
Nothing happens to the data until
another file overwrites it,

28
00:02:04.247 --> 00:02:06.901
another file gets assigned.

29
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:11.039
Are allocated to those clusters and
overwrites the data.

30
00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.261
But until that time the data stays out
on the drive, it remains unchanged.

31
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.655
We're going to actually
write some data to RVHDs and

32
00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:28.140
take a look at it what active disk editor
and see for ourselves what happens.

33
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.961
And then we're going to delete it and
look at the changes that are made.

34
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.220
What we're going to need for

35
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.499
this walkthrough is we're
going to need active disk editor.

36
00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:43.133
We're going to need our MBRVHD and
we're going to need

37
00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:47.879
Windows Explorer because
we're going to be actually

38
00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.640
writing some data to these VHDs and
then deleting it.

39
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.340
So let's start our walk through.

40
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.441
The first thing we need
to do is attach RVHD.

41
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:05.913
So let's open up this management,
go to actions,

42
00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:11.028
attach VHD navigate out to where you have

43
00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:17.061
your MBR VHD saved and
select it and click open.

44
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.380
Once it opens, it should look like
Mayan note the drive number and

45
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.456
the volume we're going to be using for
this walkthrough is

46
00:03:33.456 --> 00:03:38.870
the very first volume on the drive and
it should be fat 32.

47
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.228
Mayan is disc a yours
may be a different disk,

48
00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:52.551
but it's the very first fat 32
100 megabyte volume on the drive.

49
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.380
So let's open up active disk editor and

50
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.361
take a look at this,
so active disk editor.

51
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.863
We're going to locate our
drive a right click and

52
00:04:10.863 --> 00:04:16.315
we're going to open in disk editor.

53
00:04:21.203 --> 00:04:27.140
Once we've done that,
what we're going to do, yeah.

54
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.691
Is navigate to our root directory.

55
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.922
We can see in our root directory
the only thing we have

56
00:04:43.922 --> 00:04:51.261
in here is a volume label and a system
volume file and a recycle bin entry.

57
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.896
So I don't see any user created
files on this volume except for

58
00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:59.161
the volume label was created by user.

59
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.612
So now we're going to bring up going
ahead and minimize active disk editor and

60
00:05:06.612 --> 00:05:11.755
this management and we're going to
bring up file explorer and go to.

61
00:05:11.755 --> 00:05:18.240
Where you have that fat 32 volume mounted
and we're going to create a file.

62
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.761
So go ahead and right click select new.

63
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:31.340
I am going to do a text document,
those are easier to read in hex.

64
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.590
And now I'm going to go ahead and

65
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.844
call this new text document.

66
00:05:45.728 --> 00:05:51.951
New tech stock now that I've created it,
I'm going to put some data in it.

67
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.453
You can write anything you want.

68
00:05:55.453 --> 00:06:03.461
I am just going to write
this is a new duck.

69
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.781
I just created once you put
a little bit of data in there,

70
00:06:09.781 --> 00:06:14.340
it really doesn't matter for our purposes.

71
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.851
Go ahead and save that file and
I'm going to close it.

72
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.099
You can go ahead and minimize file
explore and we will go back and

73
00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.461
take a look at active disk editor.

74
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.679
Go ahead and close the drive.

75
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.132
And reopen the drive so
you would right click opening

76
00:06:42.132 --> 00:06:47.940
this editor and
the drive will open back up again.

77
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:55.412
Now let's navigate to the root directory
and see what changes there are.

78
00:06:56.761 --> 00:07:02.261
Now in my root directory I
see a new entry, new text.

79
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.151
Make sure we change our
templates to root directory.

80
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:18.844
Fat directory entry, highlight
the beginning of your directory entry and

81
00:07:18.844 --> 00:07:24.344
that will be the DOS alias with
the tilde in it should say new text or

82
00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:26.361
whatever you named it.

83
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.661
Go ahead and
right click say set template position.

84
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.361
We could see our directory entry here.

85
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.944
Well it did write the directory entry and

86
00:07:43.944 --> 00:07:48.570
we do have too long file
name entries above it.

87
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:55.255
So if we go to the second long file
name and you say set template position,

88
00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:59.740
it'll show you all through the entries.

89
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.340
So we have a long file name entry.

90
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.340
We know that by the OF
long file name entry.

91
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.692
And then we have our dos alias which is
our short file them entry which is where

92
00:08:10.692 --> 00:08:13.761
we're going to get all
the information about the file.

93
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:26.411
We have our last access
we would have our name,

94
00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:30.615
our extension creation date and

95
00:08:30.615 --> 00:08:36.851
time last excess state modified date and
time.

96
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.482
We have no high word but
we do have a lower that says our file

97
00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:47.740
starts in cluster a and
this will be our file size.

98
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:54.372
Mayan is 32 bytes long so
not a big file, so

99
00:08:54.372 --> 00:09:00.661
let's go ahead and look at our fat table.

100
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.787
Let's look at fat one and
let's go ahead and

101
00:09:06.787 --> 00:09:11.151
change our view because it makes it so
much easier.

102
00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:15.740
File preferences we'll change
our view to four bites.

103
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.440
We just have to change your
back when we're done though.

104
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.090
Okay bytes per line changes to four and
select OK And

105
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.561
now we can take a look at our fat table.

106
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:33.508
We have our media descriptor,
we have our fat

107
00:09:33.508 --> 00:09:39.361
version indicator which
shows us this is fat 32.

108
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.827
This would represent cluster two,
cluster three, cluster four,

109
00:09:46.827 --> 00:09:51.661
cluster five, close to six,
close to seven and cluster eight.

110
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.267
So going back to our root directory,

111
00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:04.080
we're going to go to file
preferences again and

112
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:11.061
we're going to change our view back
to 16 bytes per line click Ok.

113
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.452
We'll navigate back to the directory.

114
00:10:19.054 --> 00:10:24.261
And we'll go ahead and
look at our entry for the file.

115
00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:31.551
We created new text, we'll go ahead and
set the template position.

116
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.940
We can see our file is in cluster eight.

117
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.161
And when we looked at the fats we saw that
cluster eight was occupied by a file.

118
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.861
So now let's see if the data
was written to the drive.

119
00:10:45.861 --> 00:10:48.861
We've checked the fats,
we've checked the root directory,

120
00:10:48.861 --> 00:10:51.540
we can see that those
two things did happen.

121
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.440
Entry was made in the fat table to
show that that cluster was occupied.

122
00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.851
We have a directory entry set
written in the root directory.

123
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.226
So we're going to go to, go to sector and

124
00:11:07.226 --> 00:11:12.336
we're going to go to sector 0x,
we're going to use

125
00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:17.341
x here 08 we're going to say okay and
we go out.

126
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:21.757
We can see and this is why I
used the txt instead of a DOC.

127
00:11:21.757 --> 00:11:26.853
Because if you a word document
is not as easy to read and

128
00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.583
x as the text documents are.

129
00:11:29.583 --> 00:11:32.188
Because they have other
components to them,

130
00:11:32.188 --> 00:11:37.240
which we'll talk about later on in
this course, like headers and patty.

131
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.551
But we can see our text document here and
we see this is a new text document.

132
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.567
I just created a new tech
stock I just created that

133
00:11:48.567 --> 00:11:52.348
is what I wrote, so that's all good.

134
00:11:52.348 --> 00:11:58.461
Now let's go back out to file Explorer and
bring up our drive again.

135
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.851
Now let's go ahead, click on this file and
let's delete it and see what happens.

136
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.411
So go ahead and shift delete, so
it doesn't go to the recycle bin.

137
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:33.847
Once we've done that we can see
it's gone in file Explorer,

138
00:12:33.847 --> 00:12:40.521
file system is no longer seeing
the file to minimize this and

139
00:12:40.521 --> 00:12:44.131
let's go ahead and close this.

140
00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:48.740
We do have to reload our
drive inactive disk editor.

141
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:54.057
So close to drive,
find your drive again in the tree,

142
00:12:54.057 --> 00:12:58.201
right click on it, open and disk editor.

143
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.351
And let's go back to our root directory.

144
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.640
Now what we see in our directory
is we see the hexi five.

145
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.840
Make sure we change our templates
to fat directory entry.

146
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.980
You see the hexi five and
that replaces the first letter

147
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.461
in our file name,
in our short file name entry.

148
00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.461
But I do have long file name entries, so
let's look at the whole directory set.

149
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:42.111
So find the last long file name,
directory entry.

150
00:13:42.111 --> 00:13:47.531
And how we would do this on
a deleted file as you'd find

151
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:53.640
the DOS alias and
work your way up with zero 0F, 0F.

152
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.146
When I go to the next one I see a 16,
so I know this is not another

153
00:13:58.146 --> 00:14:03.440
long file name entry associated
with this toss alias file name.

154
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:12.051
So this is where I want to be on the E
five right click set template position.

155
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:20.780
No I can see even though I lost the first

156
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:27.530
letter right here in my short file name.

157
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:33.430
The long file name entries, don't start
with the first letter of the file.

158
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.899
The long file name entries
start with that status bite

159
00:14:37.899 --> 00:14:41.275
remember that told us the sequence, and

160
00:14:41.275 --> 00:14:46.961
it indicated when we were at the last
directory entry for that file.

161
00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.481
So I can get the first letter of that file
name even though it's been overwritten

162
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:55.540
with a hex E five.

163
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.551
Because if I go to my first
long file name entry and

164
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:03.250
I go to the first bite, the second bite
in I can see it's an end in this case and

165
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.940
see it over here in the ask.

166
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.117
So if I change that hexi five to a four e.

167
00:15:14.075 --> 00:15:18.915
I would be able to start my file
recovery which we're going to cover in

168
00:15:18.915 --> 00:15:20.261
the next section.

169
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.640
But that's how you do it.

170
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.523
And then you'd also change that
to a 01 in the store 4,2 and

171
00:15:28.523 --> 00:15:31.030
you've recovered your directory set.

172
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.393
But we will we will get to do
that in the next module so

173
00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:39.840
I could see that yes
the director entry set.

174
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.844
All the entries for my file, the long
file name and short file name entries

175
00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:50.240
have been changed to a heck C5 with
the first bite of the viol entry.

176
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.660
So let's take a look at the fats so
navigate,

177
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.161
let's go to fat one and
we're going to change our view again.

178
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.922
File, preferences let's
look at four bytes per line

179
00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:10.461
because of fat 32,
fat table entry is four bytes per line.

180
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.408
So now I see my Meteor Descriptor,

181
00:16:17.408 --> 00:16:22.461
my fat type indicator
which indicates fat 32.

182
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.554
This is cluster two because we start
cluster numbering out on the drive with

183
00:16:27.554 --> 00:16:28.251
cluster two.

184
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.340
Cluster two as an end
of file marker in it.

185
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:37.299
My next entry represents
cluster three has an end of

186
00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:40.771
file my next entry, cluster four.

187
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.771
My next fat table entry
represents cluster five.

188
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:53.140
My next one will represent cluster six,
my next entry represent cluster seven.

189
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.107
And when we look at the entry for
cluster eight we can see now that

190
00:16:58.107 --> 00:17:03.001
it's all zeros, all zeroes before
it had in the file marker.

191
00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:08.131
And we looked at it, but after we
deleted the file, we can see that we

192
00:17:08.131 --> 00:17:13.261
have all zeros in that fat table
entry representing cluster eight.

193
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:21.541
So let's go ahead and change our view
back, so file preferences, bytes per line.

194
00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:26.051
We're going to put in 16,
I'm going to say okay let's go back to

195
00:17:26.051 --> 00:17:30.581
our root directory and
let's go back to our dossier eleazar.

196
00:17:30.581 --> 00:17:32.951
Short file name entry for
the file we just deleted.

197
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.564
Let's set our template position and

198
00:17:36.564 --> 00:17:40.951
we could see we're going back the first
cluster should be close to 08.

199
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.561
So we're going to go, go to sector
we're going to navigate and hex again.

200
00:17:46.561 --> 00:17:52.495
So zero x 08 zero X 08,
we're going to say okay and

201
00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:56.040
the data hasn't changed.

202
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.642
It's exactly the same as before I
deleted it, It's still out there so

203
00:18:00.642 --> 00:18:03.451
it's very possible to recover this file.

204
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.922
Now if we write another file to the drive,

205
00:18:07.922 --> 00:18:12.340
it's possible that file
will overwrite this one.

206
00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:17.840
So just keep that in mind that
the data stays until it's overwritten.

207
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.919
But once it's overwritten it's gone.

208
00:18:25.826 --> 00:18:30.840
This ends our walkthrough for
file creation and deletion.

209
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:36.117
In our next module, we're going to talk
about recovery files so we're going to

210
00:18:36.117 --> 00:18:41.990
change some of that information we saw in
the root directory and in the fat tables.

211
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.751
And we're going to go ahead and
recover the file.
