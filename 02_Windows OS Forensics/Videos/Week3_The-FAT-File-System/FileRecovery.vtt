1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.719
In this course we're covering
the fat file system,

2
00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.750
in this module we're going to
look at fat file recovery.

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.051
We're going to talk about the steps to
recover a file in the fat file system.

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.141
The first step recovering a file and

5
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:23.815
the fat file system is we need to change

6
00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:28.780
the first bite in the directory sets from

7
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.730
A Hexi five to a different character.

8
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.558
If we know the first letter of the file,

9
00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:42.140
if the file has a long file name you
can get the first letter from that.

10
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.025
If it only has a short file name entry,

11
00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:48.650
we will change that back
to another character.

12
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.461
Any keyboard character will work.

13
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.403
The next thing we need to do is we name
to change the values in the fat table to

14
00:00:59.403 --> 00:01:05.900
indicate that the clusters are allocated
from the short file name entry.

15
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.635
We will be able to get the starting
cluster and the file size so

16
00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:16.260
we'll know which file injury and
the fat table.

17
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.340
We need to change to indicate
that it's allocated.

18
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.226
And we'll know if we need to put an end of
file marker there or if the file takes up

19
00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:29.540
more than one cluster we would need to
put a pointer to that next cluster.

20
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.861
So we will determine the cluster
size from the volume boot record.

21
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.761
Then we will calculate
the number of clusters needed.

22
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.522
Once we find out how
many clusters we need for

23
00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:48.140
our file we will divide the file size
by the cluster sides and round up.

24
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.854
That's how we're going to determine
how many clusters we need and

25
00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:58.324
once we determine that we can reach ain't
our entries in the fat table and then

26
00:01:58.324 --> 00:02:04.940
we will have successfully recovered our
file some issues with fat file recovery.

27
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.996
Well if we have fragmented
files it's going to be harder

28
00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:15.052
to recover them because if
they are not contiguous it's

29
00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:20.661
going to be very hard to tell where
that file was in the fat table.

30
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.795
Another issue is if the directory
entry was reused or overwritten and

31
00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:32.664
we don't have that short file in that
directory entry to find our starting

32
00:02:32.664 --> 00:02:34.640
cluster and file size.

33
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.061
That will make it very
difficult to recover the file.

34
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.472
And the other issue we come
across is if the data has

35
00:02:42.472 --> 00:02:45.640
been overridden out on the disk.

36
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.470
So let's start our walk through.

37
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.740
We're actually going to recover
some files from our NPR Bhd.

38
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.540
So we're going to need our NPR Bhd.

39
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.589
We're going to need our
Windows Explorer and

40
00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:05.040
we're going to need active disk editor.

41
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.610
So let's start our walk through.

42
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.351
Okay, so let's begin or walk through.

43
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.040
The first thing we need to do
is we have to go attach RVHD.

44
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.863
So we're going to bring up dis management,
we're going to go to actions,

45
00:03:22.863 --> 00:03:30.540
attach a VHD, you're going to navigate out
to where the VHD is saved on your drive.

46
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.489
You're going to select it and
then we're going to click open,

47
00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.221
once RVHD attach is for this walkthrough.

48
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:50.020
We're going to be using
the fat 32100 megabyte volume.

49
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.540
That should be the first
volume on your disk.

50
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.951
Note the dis number in the drive letter
for that fat 32100 megabit volume.

51
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.261
I want you to open up
the volume in Windows Explorer.

52
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.589
We're going to create a file.

53
00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.251
We're going to create
a folder on the volume.

54
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.582
So new folder, we're going to
call this new folder root, and

55
00:04:28.582 --> 00:04:36.010
I'm doing this because we're putting it in
the root of the volume in the root folder.

56
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.740
We're also going to create a file.

57
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.170
I'm going to use a text document and I'm
just going to call this file in root and

58
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.540
now I'm going to open the file and
write some data on it.

59
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.990
Once you put some data on there,
save the file you can close it.

60
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.761
I'm also going to create another
folder in this directory.

61
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.991
So new folder and I'm just going
to call this folder inroot and

62
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:09.361
these will have long file
name entries as we can see.

63
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.651
And in this folder I'm going to
put another new text document.

64
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:23.230
I'm just going to call it dark in
child and I'm going to open it up and

65
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.930
write some data on there and
I'm going to save it and

66
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.631
we're going to close it
now once we've done that,

67
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:40.200
I'm going to go ahead and
minimize file Explorer and

68
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.271
I'm going to open up
active disk editor now.

69
00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:52.510
Once active disk editor opens,
we want to go ahead and select our volume.

70
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.776
Remember we want that 100
megabyte fat 32 volume which

71
00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:04.431
should be the first volume
on the virtual hard drive.

72
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:09.261
You just mounted the NBRVHD.

73
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.940
So I'm going to click open disk and
now I'm going to go to volumes.

74
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.740
Now Mayan was drive letter A,
yours might be different.

75
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.148
So once you've located your
fat volume go ahead and

76
00:06:27.148 --> 00:06:32.040
right click and open in disk editor.

77
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.140
Once your volume opens we can see we
are again in the volume boot record.

78
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.605
So let's take a look here and

79
00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:45.861
find out how many sectors per
cluster we have on this volume.

80
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.731
Remember we have our bytes per sector.

81
00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:55.861
Right here in x it's zero B.

82
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.441
For a length of two bites.

83
00:06:58.441 --> 00:07:01.020
So it's going to be zero B and zero C.

84
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.040
And then at 0D we have
sectors per cluster.

85
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.961
And in this volume we have
two sectors per cluster.

86
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.561
So 10:24 bytes per cluster.

87
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.695
So now I want to navigate
to my root directory so

88
00:07:21.695 --> 00:07:25.361
we can go ahead and click on navigate.

89
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.051
We're going to navigate
to the root directory.

90
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:36.761
We're going to change our
template to fat directory entry.

91
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:48.661
We can see we have a new
entry in here called root.

92
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.990
This is that folder we just created
at the root of the volume and

93
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.140
I want to take a quick look at this.

94
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.550
So we're going here right
at the beginning of the.

95
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:08.451
Short file name entry for
root should be right here,

96
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:13.094
we're going to right click
set template position.

97
00:08:13.094 --> 00:08:17.461
Now, I want to show you something about a
directory entry that's a little different

98
00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:18.517
and a regular file.

99
00:08:18.517 --> 00:08:23.627
We're going to have the file name which is
going to be root because it's a directory,

100
00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:27.581
there are no extension,
there's no extension on a directory.

101
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:33.693
So we have dot dot dot which is
represented by hexidecimal 2 0 2 0 2 0.

102
00:08:33.693 --> 00:08:38.854
And we have our attribute,
which we could see is 1 0,

103
00:08:38.854 --> 00:08:44.703
so if we go ahead into our templates and
we expand attributes.

104
00:08:44.703 --> 00:08:48.483
We can see that this is a directory,

105
00:08:48.483 --> 00:08:52.389
now remember this is a packed bite and

106
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:57.060
we could break this out
into binary by hand.

107
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.384
And see which bit was turned on but

108
00:08:59.384 --> 00:09:04.626
that's how we tell what the attribute
is and in this case it is a directory.

109
00:09:08.793 --> 00:09:14.037
We still have the reserved,
we still have our creation

110
00:09:14.037 --> 00:09:20.315
millisecond offset time,
we still have creation date and time.

111
00:09:22.409 --> 00:09:26.213
We still have last access date, no time.

112
00:09:32.722 --> 00:09:36.759
First cluster high word
is empty in this case, so

113
00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:42.379
there is no high word and then I
would have my modified date and time.

114
00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:47.160
And then I would have my
starting cluster lowered

115
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.485
right here and
we can see this is cluster 8.

116
00:09:51.485 --> 00:09:54.402
Now, if we remember from our last module,

117
00:09:54.402 --> 00:09:57.975
there was a file in cluster
8 before we wrote a file.

118
00:09:57.975 --> 00:10:00.904
And it was located In cluster 8, so

119
00:10:00.904 --> 00:10:05.116
this file has been overwritten
by this directory.

120
00:10:05.116 --> 00:10:10.874
And we can see the file size is 0,

121
00:10:10.874 --> 00:10:16.634
the file size will always be 0 for

122
00:10:16.634 --> 00:10:23.422
a directory, I want you to know the file

123
00:10:23.422 --> 00:10:30.238
size will always be 0 for a directory.

124
00:10:30.238 --> 00:10:37.717
Now we're going to go ahead and
look at cluster 8 so,

125
00:10:37.717 --> 00:10:43.035
we're going to, go to go to sector and

126
00:10:43.035 --> 00:10:48.209
we're going to navigate in hex again.

127
00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:53.361
0x 08, we're going to say, okay and

128
00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:58.675
we can see that our file that previously

129
00:10:58.675 --> 00:11:03.023
occupied this space has now this

130
00:11:03.023 --> 00:11:07.868
cluster has now been overwritten.

131
00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:15.279
But one thing I want you to know about a
directory is when you look at a directory.

132
00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:21.129
The first entry, the very top right here,

133
00:11:21.129 --> 00:11:24.053
is going to be a dot and

134
00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:29.588
then the next entry will be a double dot.

135
00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:34.190
The first entry right here,
this dot entry,

136
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:40.983
it's red the same way we would read
an entry in the root directory.

137
00:11:40.983 --> 00:11:45.944
So, we're going to go ahead and

138
00:11:45.944 --> 00:11:50.310
set template position but

139
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:55.871
this dot entry points to itself.

140
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:59.327
What I mean by that is if you
look at the starting cluster,

141
00:11:59.327 --> 00:12:02.858
it's going to say cluster 8,
which we are in cluster 8.

142
00:12:02.858 --> 00:12:08.482
So, this first entry is
going to point to itself,

143
00:12:08.482 --> 00:12:13.134
it's saying this is me and cluster 8.

144
00:12:13.134 --> 00:12:14.842
It will have times,

145
00:12:14.842 --> 00:12:20.070
it will have an attribute which
indicates it's a directory.

146
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:25.927
It'll still have
the millisecond offset time for

147
00:12:25.927 --> 00:12:30.112
file creation, last access date,

148
00:12:30.112 --> 00:12:35.691
only modified date and
time, starting cluster

149
00:12:35.691 --> 00:12:40.583
low word in its file size will still be 0.

150
00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:46.189
The entry below this,
we're going to set template position,

151
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:52.973
I'm going to look at this this century
points to the parent of this directory.

152
00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:58.406
In this case the parent is the root
directory so, you're always going to

153
00:12:58.406 --> 00:13:04.033
see 0 0, if the parent is the directory
right here for the first cluster.

154
00:13:07.276 --> 00:13:12.380
It will tell you the information
about the parent,

155
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.060
this is the parent's millisecond,

156
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.414
offset creation, date and
time, last access date.

157
00:13:21.414 --> 00:13:25.906
Last modified date and time and
if you see 0 0, you know,

158
00:13:25.906 --> 00:13:31.518
you need to go to the root directory
to find the parent of this directory.

159
00:13:31.518 --> 00:13:34.079
That we're in right now in cluster 8,

160
00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:38.203
it will also list the files that
were created in the directory.

161
00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:45.368
And we created a file and a folder and

162
00:13:45.368 --> 00:13:49.098
they show up in our directory,

163
00:13:49.098 --> 00:13:54.119
now let's go back to the root directory,

164
00:13:54.119 --> 00:13:58.574
so we'll go to navigate directory.

165
00:14:02.995 --> 00:14:04.829
And we can see our document is deleted.

166
00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:10.565
We're going to set template manager.

167
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:21.474
We see, it's still telling us
the first cluster is cluster 8,

168
00:14:21.474 --> 00:14:27.632
this would be one of those
limitations in the fact file system.

169
00:14:29.257 --> 00:14:33.880
Because we know cluster 8
is now occupied by root.

170
00:14:37.236 --> 00:14:40.356
We just went and looked at it and

171
00:14:40.356 --> 00:14:45.396
if we look at the facts
would also see the cluster 8

172
00:14:45.396 --> 00:14:50.201
is occupied,
marked as allocated being used.

173
00:14:54.073 --> 00:14:58.636
So this is what would happen when a file
gets overwritten in the fact file system.

174
00:15:04.292 --> 00:15:11.775
Let's create a new document
in the root of the directory,

175
00:15:11.775 --> 00:15:16.672
so let's bring up our File Explorer.

176
00:15:22.369 --> 00:15:27.830
We're going to go to the root
of the directory and

177
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.898
we're going to create a new file.

178
00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:40.265
I'm going to create
a new text document and

179
00:15:40.265 --> 00:15:44.310
I'm going to call it to delete me.

180
00:15:49.709 --> 00:15:54.080
I'm going to open it up and

181
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.801
put some data on it.

182
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.903
Doesn't matter what you write,

183
00:16:06.903 --> 00:16:11.984
I just wrote this is a doc,
I will delete and

184
00:16:11.984 --> 00:16:18.771
I'm going to go ahead and
save this file and close it now.

185
00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:25.219
I'm going to minimize this,
I'm going to reload my drive and

186
00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:30.055
active disk editor Right
click on the volume,

187
00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:34.767
open in this editor again
we open at the volume

188
00:16:34.767 --> 00:16:39.851
boot record but
we've already looked at this and

189
00:16:39.851 --> 00:16:44.071
we know we have two sectors per cluster.

190
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:51.271
So I'm going to use navigate and
I'm going to go to my room directory,

191
00:16:51.271 --> 00:16:55.941
I'm going to change my template
view too root directory,

192
00:16:55.941 --> 00:17:01.971
fat directory entry and we can see our
file that we just created to leave me.

193
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:09.281
So I'm going to set my template

194
00:17:09.281 --> 00:17:13.931
position what's one down?

195
00:17:13.931 --> 00:17:18.363
I'm going to set my template position,

196
00:17:18.363 --> 00:17:23.902
I can see the starting
cluster Is close to 12 so

197
00:17:23.902 --> 00:17:28.889
first cluster cluster 12 and above it you

198
00:17:28.889 --> 00:17:33.900
can see we have the long
file name entries.

199
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.929
We have a 01 and a 42 so
we have to long file name

200
00:17:38.929 --> 00:17:44.461
entries above my short file name alias for
delete me.

201
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:53.465
Check our cluster high word just to make
sure we have no cluster high word so we

202
00:17:53.465 --> 00:17:59.471
know that are starting cluster is going to
be cluster 12 or heck suggestible Zero C.

203
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:08.643
So I'm going to go ahead and get again,

204
00:18:08.643 --> 00:18:13.300
go to navigate, go to sector and

205
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:19.164
I'm going to say zero X to signify hex and

206
00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:23.145
then I'm going to say zero C.

207
00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:26.324
I'm going to say okay and

208
00:18:26.324 --> 00:18:31.174
we can see the data is written out on

209
00:18:31.174 --> 00:18:36.371
the cluster We're in cluster 12.

210
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.542
No, I want to take a look
at the fat table So

211
00:18:43.542 --> 00:18:48.271
again I'm going to use going to
navigate and the menu of the Fat one.

212
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.987
I'm going to go to file
preferences to change my view And

213
00:18:53.987 --> 00:18:57.910
I'm going to have four bytes per line.

214
00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:03.096
Change bytes per aligned to
four I'm going to click OK now

215
00:19:03.096 --> 00:19:07.971
what I want to do Is look at the entry for
cluster 12.

216
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:14.545
So we talked about our first
entry is the media descriptor

217
00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:19.746
this is our the next entries
are fat file type indicator And

218
00:19:19.746 --> 00:19:25.922
then the 3rd entry represents cluster too,
so this is cluster too.

219
00:19:25.922 --> 00:19:30.138
Next entry represent cluster 3,
the next entry,

220
00:19:30.138 --> 00:19:34.944
cluster 4, cluster five,
cluster 6, cluster seven,

221
00:19:34.944 --> 00:19:39.770
cluster 8 cluster 9,
cluster 10, cluster 11.

222
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:43.015
And the entry,
the directory entry right here or

223
00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:47.607
the fat file table entry for
cluster 12 shows that it is occupied and

224
00:19:47.607 --> 00:19:52.461
it shows it has an end of file marker So
we know the file that is occupying.

225
00:19:52.461 --> 00:19:57.240
Cluster 12 only takes
up one cluster because

226
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.529
there's no pointer to the next cluster so

227
00:20:01.529 --> 00:20:06.330
now I'm going to go back
to file Preferences.

228
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:11.527
I'm going to change my view
from four back to 16 and

229
00:20:11.527 --> 00:20:16.476
I'm going to say okay so
we've created a file,

230
00:20:16.476 --> 00:20:21.921
we've looked at the data,
we've looked at the root

231
00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:26.771
directory and
we've looked at the fat table.

232
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.984
So now we're going to go ahead and

233
00:20:31.984 --> 00:20:38.792
bring up file explorer again and
I am going to delete,

234
00:20:38.792 --> 00:20:45.771
I'm going to right click and
shift delete to leave me.

235
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:52.437
It's going to ask me if I want to
permanently delete it and I'm going to say

236
00:20:52.437 --> 00:20:57.991
okay and now from the view of the file
system that file is no longer exists.

237
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:07.855
So let's bring up active
disk editor again,

238
00:21:07.855 --> 00:21:13.262
let's close our volume and
reload it once our

239
00:21:13.262 --> 00:21:20.450
volume reloads let's navigate
to the root directory.

240
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.198
So we're going to use
the navigate button and

241
00:21:24.198 --> 00:21:29.030
we're going to go to the root
directory of our volume now make

242
00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:33.871
sure we change our template
view too fat directory entry.

243
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:40.515
Now we're going to scroll down and
we're going to find the short file entry,

244
00:21:40.515 --> 00:21:46.050
short file name entry for the file was
just deleted which was delete me dot txt.

245
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:50.851
And we can see it down here
at the very bottom and

246
00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:56.515
we look above it,
we can see our long file name entry and

247
00:21:56.515 --> 00:22:00.471
we can see the file name to lead me txt.

248
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:10.950
Now we need to change this Hexi decimal E
five to the first letter of the file name.

249
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.579
Now because we have
the long file name entry,

250
00:22:14.579 --> 00:22:20.691
we know the first letter of the file name
because of the long file name entry,

251
00:22:20.691 --> 00:22:26.650
the first bite has changed the five but
that's our status bite.

252
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:31.051
That's what tells us our sequence
number of our long file entry and

253
00:22:31.051 --> 00:22:35.687
it also indicates when we've reached
the last long file name entry for

254
00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:38.061
that file name, directory entry.

255
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:45.801
So we need to go into edit mode, so
we're going to go up to our menu bar

256
00:22:45.801 --> 00:22:50.690
I'm going to click edit and down here,
you see allow edit content.

257
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.284
We're going to check that
now just know that you would

258
00:22:55.284 --> 00:22:59.481
not do this on real evidence,
you would do this.

259
00:22:59.481 --> 00:23:03.518
If you made a copy of your image,
your working copy and

260
00:23:03.518 --> 00:23:07.642
you would work off of that,
it would be a copy of a copy,

261
00:23:07.642 --> 00:23:14.550
never the original evidence and never
your only copy of the original evidence.

262
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:20.046
Remember this is a short file name alias
so it has to be a capital letter even

263
00:23:20.046 --> 00:23:25.950
though I named it with a small d,
it still has to be a capital letter here.

264
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:30.738
So we're going to go to the ask E and
write a capital d,

265
00:23:30.738 --> 00:23:36.550
capital D and lower case d are not
the same packs a decimal E.

266
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:41.427
You would have to look that up in an a ski
chart to find out what a capital D is but

267
00:23:41.427 --> 00:23:44.477
you're able to right in
the ass key capital D and

268
00:23:44.477 --> 00:23:48.461
it'll automatically write
the correct text value for that.

269
00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:56.178
Now our long file name entry, let's take
a look, we look at the attribute bite and

270
00:23:56.178 --> 00:24:00.820
it is a long file name entry and
we can see the long file name.

271
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:07.514
An ASCII tests off at the right,
just to make sure that's our last one,

272
00:24:07.514 --> 00:24:13.205
let's look again at offset 0B,
of the file entry above it,

273
00:24:13.205 --> 00:24:18.020
the file directory entry and
we don't see, a 0F.

274
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.731
A hexidecimal 0F so we know,
that is not a long file name entry.

275
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.205
So we know we need to change our E5 for

276
00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:33.761
indicating the last long file
name entry in the directory

277
00:24:33.761 --> 00:24:38.749
set in one because it's
also the first one so 41.

278
00:24:41.523 --> 00:24:45.787
So we've changed our
directory entries which was

279
00:24:45.787 --> 00:24:48.941
the first step recovering our file.

280
00:24:48.941 --> 00:24:52.967
Now, let's take a look at the short file
name directory entry, so go ahead and

281
00:24:52.967 --> 00:24:57.652
set your template position, We want to

282
00:24:57.652 --> 00:25:01.654
know the starting cluster and
the size of the file.

283
00:25:01.654 --> 00:25:08.944
Starting cluster is 12, and
the size of the file, is 27 bytes.

284
00:25:08.944 --> 00:25:12.018
We know from our volume boot record,

285
00:25:12.018 --> 00:25:17.769
that our cluster size was two
sectors which would be 1024 bytes,

286
00:25:17.769 --> 00:25:23.932
so we know we're only going to need one
cluster to write this 27 byte file.

287
00:25:23.932 --> 00:25:27.514
And we know we need to go
out to cluster 12, and

288
00:25:27.514 --> 00:25:30.480
show it as allocated in the end of file.

289
00:25:32.162 --> 00:25:36.378
So now let's navigate to the FATs,
let's navigate to FAT one,

290
00:25:36.378 --> 00:25:39.340
let's change our view to make this easier.

291
00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:46.023
So File > Preferences,
change this to four bytes per line,

292
00:25:46.023 --> 00:25:51.932
click OK, and
now let's take a look at our FAT table.

293
00:25:51.932 --> 00:25:55.183
We have our media descriptor
right here at the top,

294
00:25:55.183 --> 00:25:57.461
which is the first four byte entry.

295
00:25:57.461 --> 00:26:01.956
The second four byte entery in the FAT
table is going to be the FAT type

296
00:26:01.956 --> 00:26:06.641
indicator, which shows us it's
FF FF FF which indicates FAT32.

297
00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:13.226
Our next entry in our FAT table
is going to show us the entry for

298
00:26:13.226 --> 00:26:16.915
cluster two,
because we start at cluster two.

299
00:26:16.915 --> 00:26:22.451
And cluster too has an end of file
marker as we move down to cluster 3,

300
00:26:22.451 --> 00:26:27.797
we're going to move down to cluster 4,
5 cluster 6, cluster 7,

301
00:26:27.797 --> 00:26:32.379
cluster 8, cluster 9,
cluster 10, cluster 11,

302
00:26:32.379 --> 00:26:36.793
cluster 12,
this is where we want to be cluster 12.

303
00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:42.978
because it was 0C and
0C in hex would be 12, so

304
00:26:42.978 --> 00:26:47.341
we need to put an end
of file marker in here.

305
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.845
So we're going to simply type FF, FF, FF,

306
00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:59.735
0F, so
we're going to go over to Edit now, and

307
00:26:59.735 --> 00:27:06.726
get out of edit mode so
uncheck, Allow Edit Content.

308
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:12.527
Now we're also going to go
to File > Preferences and

309
00:27:12.527 --> 00:27:14.841
go back to 16 Bytes per line.

310
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:21.152
The last thing we're going to do is
we're going to go to go to Sector,

311
00:27:22.194 --> 00:27:25.369
And we're going to go to cluster 12, so

312
00:27:25.369 --> 00:27:30.087
we're going to type in hex 0X
to indicate hex and then 0C and

313
00:27:30.087 --> 00:27:35.688
we're going to click Enter, and
we can see our data is out on the drive.

314
00:27:39.287 --> 00:27:44.234
So now if I went to browser and
then went to File Preview,

315
00:27:44.234 --> 00:27:47.090
I'd be able to see my data here.

316
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:51.037
Close this we have to close
active disk editor in order for

317
00:27:51.037 --> 00:27:52.692
it to save the changes.

318
00:27:52.692 --> 00:27:56.621
So we're going to close the drive first,
so we close the drive and

319
00:27:56.621 --> 00:27:59.662
it's going to ask us you've
modified this drive,

320
00:27:59.662 --> 00:28:03.091
do you want to save the changes and
we're going to say yes.

321
00:28:06.637 --> 00:28:10.300
Now go ahead and close active this editor,

322
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:14.382
now we're going to bring
up file explorer again.

323
00:28:14.382 --> 00:28:17.036
And when we refresh it,

324
00:28:17.036 --> 00:28:22.745
we see our deleteme.txt is
in the file explorer and

325
00:28:22.745 --> 00:28:27.787
we double click on it,
we can see then it comes

326
00:28:27.787 --> 00:28:32.802
up, This is a doc I will delete.

327
00:28:32.802 --> 00:28:37.019
So we have completely
recovered deleteme.txt and

328
00:28:37.019 --> 00:28:42.118
we followed the steps,
we fixed the root directory entries,

329
00:28:42.118 --> 00:28:48.113
we changed the hexi decimal E5 back
to the first letter of the file name.

330
00:28:48.113 --> 00:28:52.675
Because we knew the first letter of the
file name because it had a long file name

331
00:28:52.675 --> 00:28:56.269
entry and we were able to see
the D in the long file name entry.

332
00:28:56.269 --> 00:29:02.413
And then we were able to retain
the short file name entry,

333
00:29:02.413 --> 00:29:06.370
because we changed the hexi five to a D.

334
00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:11.537
And in the long file name entry,
we changed the status byte

335
00:29:11.537 --> 00:29:16.387
to a 4 indicating it was
the last one in the sequence and

336
00:29:16.387 --> 00:29:21.520
a 1, because it was also
the first long file name entry.

337
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:26.625
And we verified that that long file
name entry belonged to that file.

338
00:29:26.625 --> 00:29:33.003
That takes us to the end of our FAT
file course in our next course,

339
00:29:33.003 --> 00:29:38.215
we're going to be talking
about the NTFS file system.
