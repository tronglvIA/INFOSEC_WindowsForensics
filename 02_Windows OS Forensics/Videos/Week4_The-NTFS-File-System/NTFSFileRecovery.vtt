1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.545
We're on Course 9 talking
about the NTFS file system.

2
00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.140
In this module, Module 6,

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.025
we're going to talk about
NTFS file recovery.

4
00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.350
As we saw in our last module,

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.660
when we delete a file and NTFS,

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.395
the data will remain intact
until it is overwritten.

7
00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.830
Its MFT file record
will also remain

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.380
intact until this is
reused by another file.

9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.350
Data that is non-resident

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.790
remains until it is
overwritten by new a file.

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.129
If the data is resident,

12
00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.170
it will remain until the
MFT file record is re-used.

13
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.400
How do we find these
unallocated files?

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.765
Well, we can search for file
records using the word file.

15
00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:55.470
In a keyword search,

16
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.755
we could do a grep search using

17
00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:00.930
a regular expression for

18
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.560
deleted file records as we
see up here on the screen,

19
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.120
that would be the expression.

20
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.355
We will be looking for
/x46/x49/x4C4.5, which is file.

21
00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:15.990
Then we'd be going to an
offset {18} and looking for a

22
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.960
[/x00/x02] to either indicate

23
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.515
a deleted file or
deleted directory.

24
00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.850
Our forensic tools are able to

25
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.475
search for deleted file records.

26
00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:31.935
We could examine the recycle
bin if the file which

27
00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:33.305
just set to the recycle bin

28
00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:35.420
they're not permanently deleted.

29
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.660
We could use keyword searches
if we know the name of

30
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.575
the file or some data that
was contained in the file.

31
00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:45.950
We can search for
the data using grep,

32
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.610
but we could carve for files
and using file headers

33
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.990
and then we'll talk about
that would cover file carbon.

34
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.580
But those are some
ways we can recover

35
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.050
deleted files in the
NTFS file system.

36
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.350
A. We're going to do
another walk-through.

37
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.410
The items you're going to
need for this walk-through,

38
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.675
we're going to need
active disk editor.

39
00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:09.080
We're going to need our NTFS VHD,

40
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.430
and we're going to need our
regular expression documents.

41
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.800
The first thing we're going
to need to do for a module is

42
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.860
mount our NTFS VHD.

43
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.140
We're going to go
to disk management.

44
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.995
We're going to go to
Actions, attach VHD.

45
00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:28.040
We're going to
navigate out to where

46
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.715
the VHD say they're not computer.

47
00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:32.685
Mine is on my desktop.

48
00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.685
We're going to
select the NTFS VHD.

49
00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:37.545
We're going to click Open,

50
00:02:37.545 --> 00:02:40.570
and then you're
going to say, okay.

51
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.975
Once you attach your VHD,

52
00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:47.810
note the disk number

53
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.075
and the volume you're
going to be working with,

54
00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:54.490
this the second volume in
our first NTFS volume.

55
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.500
It should be 200
megabytes in size and

56
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.830
the volume should
be labeled NTFS.

57
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.220
Once you've done that,

58
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.990
we're going to go ahead and
open up active disk editor.

59
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.730
Once active disk editor
opens, select open disk.

60
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.695
Now, we're going to select

61
00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:29.080
volumes from a selection
bar on the top.

62
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.270
Then we're going to
select our disk.

63
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.505
My unmounted is B.

64
00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:36.860
There is maybe a
different drive letter

65
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.270
and we're going to click Open,

66
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.670
and it's going to open up
to our volume boot record.

67
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.910
Now, let's go to

68
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.385
our browser file records

69
00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:56.310
right underneath the
Edit next to Unicode.

70
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.020
We're going to look for
that file, deleteme.

71
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.095
TXT.

72
00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:08.170
We see it is not here.

73
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.075
Now, we do know the sector,

74
00:04:12.075 --> 00:04:15.460
but let's find it
without using that.

75
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.765
We're going to use
the find function.

76
00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:25.940
Go to Find, and I want you to go

77
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.840
ahead and paste that
regular expression

78
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.135
in from your regular
expression document.

79
00:04:32.135 --> 00:04:37.245
Highlight it, Right-click, Copy,

80
00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:41.980
then Left-click here
and select Paste.

81
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.620
Once you've done that,

82
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.895
it should look like the
one up here on the screen.

83
00:04:49.895 --> 00:04:52.230
You should have

84
00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.850
/x46/x49/x4C/x45.

85
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:14.400
{18}

86
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.620
[/x00/x02].

87
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.790
Make sure you check the box
for use regular expression.

88
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.010
Then go ahead and
select, Find All.

89
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.875
This will take a minute to
run through as it goes.

90
00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:39.805
It does go pretty quickly.

91
00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:44.120
You can see and our
find results paint.

92
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.650
If this is not showing,

93
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.240
just go to View,

94
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.685
go to Windows and
make sure you have

95
00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:55.230
the checkmark in find
results, this will show up.

96
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.710
Let's look at our results.

97
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.100
Well, it appears that

98
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.470
is not the file record
we're looking for.

99
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.370
That looks like it's a directory.

100
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.660
Still looks like a directory.

101
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.340
It's still a directory.

102
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.530
Here we are. We found
our file record.

103
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.210
Well, let's take a look at it.

104
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.020
We know it's an NTFS file record

105
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.790
because we have the ASCII file,

106
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:54.730
and we can see our sequence
number is still two.

107
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.400
The file is deleted.

108
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.070
Originally it was a 01
when we first created it,

109
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.020
and now it's a 02,

110
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.870
and we can see our flag is 00,

111
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:10.435
which indicate an unallocated
file, deleted file.

112
00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:12.910
But, what's important too to

113
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.520
remember is our attributes
are still here.

114
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.095
We still have all our
dates and times created,

115
00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:25.585
modified, record change,
last access time.

116
00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:32.080
We still have our flags,
our file permissions.

117
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.420
We still have our filename

118
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.860
with the filename,
dates, and times.

119
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.620
We still have all our filename,

120
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.850
dates, and times down here.

121
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.410
We still know the
parent directory.

122
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.570
Now, this parent
directory may be deleted,

123
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.910
but we still do know where
the parent directory is.

124
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:03.170
It's MFT record number 5
and we can look at that.

125
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.670
You can see our record change,

126
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.650
and you see our allocated size,

127
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.260
our real size, and because it's

128
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.970
deleted you're
getting zeros here.

129
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.660
We can see the length
of the file name.

130
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.310
We can see the filename,
Delete Me.txt.

131
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:44.360
We can still see our object ID.

132
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.015
We still have our globally
unique identifier

133
00:08:49.015 --> 00:08:51.925
in our data attribute.

134
00:08:51.925 --> 00:08:57.440
We still have the data that
we wrote into our file.

135
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.910
That is one way to search

136
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.945
for deleted master
file table records.

137
00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:07.135
Well, let's try another way.

138
00:09:07.135 --> 00:09:11.260
Let's try and ask the file search

139
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.580
using the word delete me,

140
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.005
and see what we come up with.

141
00:09:17.005 --> 00:09:20.185
We'll go ahead and click

142
00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.640
on our ''Find window'' and we'll

143
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.055
remove all so we clear that up.

144
00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:29.870
We'll go back to the
start of our MFT record.

145
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.950
Go ahead and click on ''Dollar

146
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.275
MFT'' just to bring
it back to the start.

147
00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:37.240
We'll go back to our find.

148
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:45.445
Now, in NTFS, we use Unicode.

149
00:09:45.445 --> 00:09:48.490
Click Restore Defaults on this,

150
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.460
but in NTFS we use Unicode.

151
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.170
Don't use ANS up here,

152
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.690
or you will not get a hit.

153
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:07.100
In Unicode, we're going
to write, Delete Me.

154
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.820
Now, icon space, you
may not have this.

155
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.015
The other thing we want
to check is Ignore Case.

156
00:10:19.015 --> 00:10:20.965
We want to ignore case on this.

157
00:10:20.965 --> 00:10:22.390
Most of the time unless you're

158
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.720
sure when you're doing a
keyword search like this,

159
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.715
you want to ignore case.

160
00:10:27.715 --> 00:10:31.160
Then, I'm going to
select Find all.

161
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.900
We'll take a minute
to run through here.

162
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:46.395
Once it's finished, we'll
look in our Find Pane again.

163
00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:48.120
Again, If you don't have this,

164
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.655
use the View button,

165
00:10:49.655 --> 00:10:52.390
Windows, and make sure

166
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.655
you have the final
results checked.

167
00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:58.190
Let's take a look at our results.

168
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:03.665
That doesn't look right.

169
00:11:03.665 --> 00:11:11.510
No, no.

170
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.640
This one does.

171
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:27.730
Let's try putting our
template manager.

172
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:38.290
Yes, this is our NTFS file record

173
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.875
for the file to deleteme.txt.

174
00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:46.960
We can see where it hit
in the dark yellow.

175
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.560
But, we needed to
search in Unicode.

176
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.400
Remember, NTFS writes
data in Unicode.

177
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.380
Very important to remember that.

178
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.315
We still have all the information

179
00:12:01.315 --> 00:12:02.860
like we had before
when we looked at

180
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.100
it and we searched with
our regular expression.

181
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:13.090
This is one way we can
recover a file or two ways

182
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.920
you could recover a file in

183
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.590
NTFS by searching
for the file record.

184
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.690
We could use a
regular expression,

185
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.195
or if we did know the
name of the file,

186
00:12:22.195 --> 00:12:23.995
we could use the
name of the file,

187
00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:27.410
but just remember to
search in Unicode.
