1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.000
We're talking about the NTFS file system.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.538
And in this module, we're going to talk
about NTFS file creation and deletion.

3
00:00:12.538 --> 00:00:20.440
When a file or directory is created in
NTFS, these are the steps that happened.

4
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.061
A file record is created in
the master file table for that file.

5
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.600
The bitmap for the MFT record is changed
to indicate the record is allocated.

6
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.588
Now that's a bitmap relating to the MFT
is going to show that that file

7
00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:41.361
record within the MFT is allocated.

8
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.537
The record header allocation flag
shows it as an allocated file or

9
00:00:48.537 --> 00:00:53.343
directory, depending on if it's a file or
folder.

10
00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:57.999
The attributes are written
to the FFT file record.

11
00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:03.734
If the data is non resident,
the $Bitmap file is updated

12
00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:10.040
to represent the clusters
allocated to store the data.

13
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.712
So if it's non resident, the $Bitmap file,

14
00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:18.891
that system file we talked about
at the beginning of this course,

15
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:24.839
will be updated to represent the clusters
are allocated to store the data.

16
00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:29.277
When a file is deleted,
the record header sequence count,

17
00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:34.720
remember we talked about that sequence
byte, that is increased by one.

18
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.336
That happens when the file is deleted.

19
00:01:37.336 --> 00:01:43.096
The record header allocation flag,
we're talking about the file record,

20
00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:46.161
indicates a deleted file or directory.

21
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.140
That's what happens to
the file record in the MFT.

22
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.862
The bitmap for the master file table,

23
00:01:54.862 --> 00:02:00.211
the $MFT bitmap is changed
to show that the file record

24
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:05.459
within the MFT is now unallocated and
able to be used.

25
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.219
If the file data is non resident,
not residing within the MFT,

26
00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:17.861
the $Bitmap file is updated to
indicate the clusters are unallocated.

27
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.468
The data itself does not become
overwritten until if it's

28
00:02:24.468 --> 00:02:29.597
a resident file,
the master file table entry is reused, or

29
00:02:29.597 --> 00:02:35.251
if it's non resident,
the data is overwritten out on the drive.

30
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.910
We're going to do a walkthrough.

31
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.270
We're going to create a file and
then delete it and

32
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.829
the items we're going to need
are going to be Active Disk Editor,

33
00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.990
NTFS VHD, and Windows Explorer.

34
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.738
Okay, the first thing we're
going to need to do for

35
00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:57.540
our walk through is attach our VHD.

36
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.840
So we're going to go to Disk Management.

37
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.440
Then we're going to go to Actions,
Attach VHD.

38
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.340
We're going to navigate out to
where we saved our NTFS VHD.

39
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.311
We're going to select it and hit Open.

40
00:03:14.311 --> 00:03:17.389
Once we're sure we have the right VHD,

41
00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.946
we're going to click OK and
the VHD will mount.

42
00:03:23.478 --> 00:03:29.310
Once your virtual hard drive mounts,
note the disk number and the drive letter,

43
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.455
the volume we're going to use for
this walk through is going to be the first

44
00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:39.086
NTFS volume on this drive which
should be your second volume in,

45
00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:43.251
titled NTFS, and
it should be 200 megabytes in size.

46
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.295
So remember the drive letter.

47
00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:48.351
Mine is B but yours could be different.

48
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.651
Then we're going to go ahead and
create a file on that drive.

49
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.726
So bring up your NTFSB
in File Explorer and

50
00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:06.287
I've created a text document
here called Delete Me.txt.

51
00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:13.581
To create a text document,
all you have to do is right click New,

52
00:04:13.581 --> 00:04:18.861
Text Document, then name it Delete Me.txt.

53
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.340
Once you've done that, go ahead and
open it up and put some data in there.

54
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.054
I just wrote,
this is a file that I will delete.

55
00:04:27.054 --> 00:04:29.640
Then we will recover it later.

56
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.829
You can write anything you want in there
but just put some data in there and

57
00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:39.101
then hit File, Save, and
then go ahead and close the file.

58
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.474
Once you've done that, go ahead and
open up Active Disk Editor.

59
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:58.191
When Active Disk Editor launches
you're going to go to open Disk and

60
00:04:58.191 --> 00:05:06.540
now we're going to go to Volumes
in our selection bar next to Disk.

61
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.576
We're going to select volumes and we're
going to select that NTFS volume again,

62
00:05:11.576 --> 00:05:17.140
mine's B, yours could be different,
and we're going to select open.

63
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.532
Now when it opens up, it's going to take
us to the volume boot record like it

64
00:05:21.532 --> 00:05:24.711
usually does but
we want to browse the file records.

65
00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:29.261
So we're going to select browse file
records right under the Edit button.

66
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.724
And we're going to scroll down and
we're going to find that Delete Me.txt and

67
00:05:35.724 --> 00:05:39.361
we're going to take a look at
its file record for a minute.

68
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.531
It starts with our S Key file, so we know
we're looking at an NTFS file record.

69
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.561
You can see the flags and the flags
indicate that it is a allocated file.

70
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.540
Hexi decimal 0 1 indicates it is
in use and it is not a directory.

71
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.961
So that indicates allocated file.

72
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.639
So we could see that it's allocated,
we could see the attributes,

73
00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.688
we could see the data attributes.

74
00:06:19.688 --> 00:06:23.676
We can see that in our case this
is a resident data attribute and

75
00:06:23.676 --> 00:06:24.914
the data is there.

76
00:06:24.914 --> 00:06:29.840
This is a file that I will delete
then we will recover it later.

77
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.761
What I want you to do is note
the sector number we're on.

78
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.833
So go ahead and
write that sector number down.

79
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.440
136 630 is what my

80
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.361
sector number is.

81
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.061
Yours may be different but
just write your sector number down.

82
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.484
Okay, now what we're going to do is we're
going to is we're going to go ahead and

83
00:06:59.484 --> 00:07:00.476
close the volume.

84
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.708
And we're going to close
Active Disk Editor.

85
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.559
We're going to bring up
File Explorer again.

86
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.351
Now we're going to
highlight Delete Me.txt.

87
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.070
We're going to hold down our Shift key.

88
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.880
We're going to right click and
we're going to delete this file.

89
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.960
And it's going to ask you if you're
sure you want to permanently delete it.

90
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.614
And we're going to say yes.

91
00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:31.340
By holding down the shift key,
we're bypassing the recycle bin.

92
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.300
I'll show you it is not
in the recycle bin.

93
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.631
That's not the same file but
it is not in the recycle bin.

94
00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:45.155
There's no Delete Me.txt
in the recycle bin.

95
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.392
Now what we're going to do is
we're going to go ahead and

96
00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:58.940
go to Active Disk Editor.

97
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.927
So we're going to relaunch
Active Disk Editor.

98
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.284
We're going to open disk again.

99
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.712
We're going to select volumes.

100
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.685
We're going to select our NTFS volume
that we were working with before.

101
00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:24.561
We're going to click Open.

102
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.061
Now we're going to, again, go to
Browse File Records right under Edit.

103
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:38.451
And we're going to scroll through and
we no longer see Delete Me.txt.

104
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.463
It's no longer listed here.

105
00:08:43.463 --> 00:08:46.920
So now we're going to
navigate out to that sector.

106
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:54.859
So we're going to go go to sector, And

107
00:08:54.859 --> 00:08:57.461
we're going to go ahead and
type in the sector.

108
00:09:05.092 --> 00:09:06.374
And we're going to click OK.

109
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.240
We can see it takes us
out to a file record.

110
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.011
So change your template
to say NTFS MFT Record,

111
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:24.917
highlight the F in file, right click and

112
00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:27.961
set template position.

113
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.140
Now we can see the offsets
in our file record.

114
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.960
We can see that it's an AASCII file.

115
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.000
We look at the flags now,
the flags have changed.

116
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.213
They're no longer 01,
they're 00 which says it is not

117
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:54.061
so it's able to be written to and
it is not a directory.

118
00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.947
So it is an unallocated
file at this point,

119
00:10:00.947 --> 00:10:04.157
deleted unallocated file.

120
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.276
And we noticed the sequence
byte has changed from

121
00:10:12.276 --> 00:10:16.240
01 to 02 because we deleted it.

122
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.452
So the sequence byte has implemented
by one and the flags have changed.

123
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:33.711
So in our next module, we're going to talk
about how we would recover that file.

124
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.829
But I just wanted to show you the changes
that will happen in the MFT Record.

125
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:43.148
Your sequence byte will
increase by one and

126
00:10:43.148 --> 00:10:46.661
your flags will show
that it is unallocated.
