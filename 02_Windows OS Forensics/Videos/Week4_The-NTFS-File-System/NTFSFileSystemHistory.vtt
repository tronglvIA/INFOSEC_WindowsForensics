1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.355
In Course 9, we're going to
discuss the NTFS file system.

2
00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:09.510
An overview of what we'll
be covering in this course.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.010
We're going to talk about

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.780
the data structures that make up

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.730
the NTFS file system like

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.915
the Volume Boot Record and
the Master File Table.

7
00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:21.600
We're also going to take a
look at the attributes that

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.110
make up file entries in
the Master File Table.

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.220
We're going to cover NTFS
date and time format.

10
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.680
We're going to talk
about file creation,

11
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.450
what happens when
we create a file in

12
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.035
the NTFS file system and what
happens when we delete it.

13
00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:38.550
We're also going to talk about

14
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.805
the recovery
limitations with NTFS.

15
00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:46.065
Course 9, Module 1,

16
00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:48.235
we're going to talk
about the history

17
00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:50.755
of the NTFS file system.

18
00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:56.315
NTFS was originally a joint
collaboration with IBM.

19
00:00:56.315 --> 00:01:01.240
It is compliant with what
they call POSIX requirements.

20
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.700
POSIX requires a
certain amount of

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.260
functionality from
the file system,

22
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.660
like the ability for a file
to have more than one name

23
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.085
or a hard link and also
case-sensitive file naming.

24
00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:20.455
Neither FAT nor HPFS
supports these features,

25
00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:21.940
which is another reason why

26
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.550
a new file system was
required for Windows NT.

27
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.680
NTFS does support

28
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.055
both hard links and
case-sensitive naming.

29
00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:35.105
If you want to run in a
POSIX compliant environment,

30
00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:36.650
you would need at least one

31
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.890
NTFS disk partition
on your computer.

32
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.470
The first release was Windows NT,

33
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.210
and that was Version
1.0 Windows NT 3.1.

34
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.285
Then we went to Version
1.2 in Windows NT 3.51.

35
00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:59.030
These two versions offered

36
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.920
some administrative controls as

37
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.960
well as that POSIX requirements.

38
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.780
We could also have
compressed files and

39
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.645
User Access Control,
user access control.

40
00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:10.985
Each user had their
own recycle bin

41
00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.255
and each user could
have their own account.

42
00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:16.385
That is something we
did not have with FAT.

43
00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:18.630
The modern version of

44
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.280
Windows NTFS that you're
going to see is Version 3.1,

45
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.130
and that's with all installations

46
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.785
of Windows XP and above.

47
00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:31.670
What we had here that we
didn't have before was we now

48
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.230
have rollback and more
robust logging features,

49
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.360
so we can recover our data and

50
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.205
rollback our file system
to a stable state.

51
00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:43.355
It can also handle
larger volumes.

52
00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:45.335
When we got to Windows 8,

53
00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:47.539
we had some faster file recovery

54
00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.110
and we could use
some cross-platform.

55
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.330
We had those built-in
applications that we could use

56
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.420
cross-platform on cell
phones and other devices.

57
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.040
We went to Windows 10,

58
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.025
we got a lot of extended
logging features,

59
00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:02.510
a lot of rollback features,

60
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.190
and a lot of logging,

61
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.190
which is helpful to us
as forensic examiners.

62
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.455
Almost on any modern
version of Windows,

63
00:03:12.455 --> 00:03:14.000
Windows Vista and above,

64
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.160
are going to require an NTFS

65
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.345
formatted volume to
be installed on.

66
00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:22.480
When talking about NTFS,
we need to remember,

67
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.380
everything in NTFS
is stored as a file.

68
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.115
You'll hear that a lot
throughout this course.

69
00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:30.785
When we talk about offsets,

70
00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:33.125
we're talking about
offsets relative

71
00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:35.845
to the start of the data
structure we're examining.

72
00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:37.320
If we're looking at

73
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.305
the Volume Boot Record and
we're talking about Offset 03,

74
00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:45.425
that would be from the start
of the Volume Boot Record,

75
00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:49.110
not from the start of
the physical disk.

76
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.545
The entire logical volume is
now considered a data area.

77
00:03:54.545 --> 00:03:57.845
Unlike FAT where we had a
system area and a data area,

78
00:03:57.845 --> 00:04:00.770
in NTFS, the entire
logical volume

79
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.685
is considered the data area.

80
00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:07.740
We have something on NTFS
called the Master File Table.

81
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.640
The Master File
Table is an index of

82
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.540
every file on the entire
volume, including itself.

83
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.244
The Master File Table will
include the NTFS system files,

84
00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:23.960
and those will begin
with a dollar sign,

85
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.500
and those are considered
metadata files.

86
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.444
These files get created

87
00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:34.245
when the NTFS volume
is formatted.

88
00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:36.240
Metadata files.

89
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.125
These are information about

90
00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:42.385
other files, external metadata.

91
00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:46.595
All the files are going
to have a metadata file.

92
00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:49.760
The first 26 records

93
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.670
in the Master File Table
are going to be these

94
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.890
metadata system
files because even

95
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.585
though everything is
considered the data area,

96
00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:01.820
the file system still
needs to operate.

97
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.540
So you're going to need
to have system files.

98
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.660
Records 12-23 are reserved
for future use and Records

99
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.180
24 through 26 are used for

100
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.670
transaction logs
and error recovery.

101
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.650
The first user-created file will

102
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.740
usually be somewhere
around Record 35.

103
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.180
When we talk about these
metadata files, in this table,

104
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.370
you can see the very first entry

105
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.930
in the Master File Table will be

106
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.100
zero and that will be

107
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.935
a record for the Master
File Table itself.

108
00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:37.530
The next entry, Entry 1,

109
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.040
in the Master File Table
will be the MFT Mirror,

110
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.780
which is a backup of

111
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.010
the first few entries of

112
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.540
the Master File Table
for recovery purposes.

113
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.140
Then you can see the third
entry will be $Volume.

114
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.605
We can see Entry number 5
is represented by a dot.

115
00:05:58.605 --> 00:06:00.975
This is the root directory,

116
00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:03.150
the Root File Name Index.

117
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.660
These would be a listing
of files that are in

118
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.855
the root of the directory,
the root of the volume.

119
00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:11.330
Seven will be $Boot,

120
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.080
and this is going to
be our Boot Sector.

121
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.655
Then we see Entry 11 is extended.

122
00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:20.495
These are going to contain
our extended attributes.

123
00:06:20.495 --> 00:06:23.440
I've talked about the ones
that are highlighted.

124
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.100
If you can see, there
were several others.

125
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.915
The ones that are not
highlighted, like LogFile,

126
00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:34.075
simply keeps track of logging
for rollback purposes.

127
00:06:34.075 --> 00:06:36.740
Bitmap. We talked about

128
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.040
bitmaps when we talked about
the exFAT file system.

129
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.315
This is what tracks
cluster allocation.

130
00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:47.530
BadClus obviously keeps track

131
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.390
of the bad clusters
on the volume.

132
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.270
We have Secure and UpCase.

133
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.875
Secure keeps track
of security features

134
00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:01.445
and UpCase keeps track
of upper and lowercase.

135
00:07:01.445 --> 00:07:06.330
This is for case-specific
file naming.

136
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.955
It'll convert upper to lowercase,

137
00:07:08.955 --> 00:07:10.480
so we can search the volume,

138
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.000
but also allows
case-specific file naming.

139
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.385
We have one called Quota.

140
00:07:16.385 --> 00:07:17.950
Quotas can be put on

141
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.275
how much data certain
users are allowed to use.

142
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:23.160
ObjectID.

143
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.000
Each object does have

144
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.185
an identifier that is
recorded in ObjectID.

145
00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:30.775
Then we have Reparse,

146
00:07:30.775 --> 00:07:33.095
which would be a reparse point.

147
00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:35.720
The ones we highlighted are
the ones we're going to talk

148
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.359
about throughout this course.

149
00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:41.600
I just wanted to make you
aware that there are 26 of

150
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.200
them and these are our
system metadata files.

151
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.225
They are the first 26 entries
in the Master File Table.

152
00:07:49.225 --> 00:07:51.420
In our next module,

153
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.680
we're going to talk about

154
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.330
the NTFS Volume Boot
Record and discuss

155
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.940
the information contained in

156
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.130
the boot record and
how we would read it.
