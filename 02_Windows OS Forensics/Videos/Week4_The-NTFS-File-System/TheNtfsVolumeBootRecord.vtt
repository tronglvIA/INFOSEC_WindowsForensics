1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.084
Course nine, the NTFS file system,
and we're on module two.

2
00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:10.540
In module two, we're going to talk
about the NTFS volume boot record.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.880
Now in the NTFS volume boot record,
we'll see represented as dollar boot.

4
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.716
And we talked about that when we
saw our system metadata files,

5
00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:27.662
dollar boot was our boot sector, and this
is going to be our volume boot record.

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.300
It is sector 0 of the volume.

7
00:00:33.403 --> 00:00:38.114
Not the physical disk, but
the volume we're looking at.

8
00:00:38.114 --> 00:00:42.248
And we can see the information
contained in here,

9
00:00:42.248 --> 00:00:48.067
we're going to see our OEM ID or
operating system, it's going to be NTFS.

10
00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:54.740
We're going to see our bytes per sector,
our sectors per cluster.

11
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.540
We're going to get total sectors in
the volume, and the volume serial number.

12
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.478
Now all this information is related
to the volume structure and

13
00:01:03.478 --> 00:01:04.970
the size of the volume.

14
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.563
Also contained in the volume boot record,

15
00:01:07.563 --> 00:01:11.940
we're going to get information
regarding the master file table.

16
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.014
We're going to get the starting
cluster of the master file table,

17
00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:20.465
the starting cluster of the MFT mirror
that backup copy of the first few

18
00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:23.240
entries of the master file table.

19
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.961
And we're also going to see our master
file table record size in clusters.

20
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.348
This is what our volume boot record
is going to look at it when we

21
00:01:35.348 --> 00:01:37.813
view it through a hex editor.

22
00:01:37.813 --> 00:01:42.661
You can see here right at offset 03,
starts at OEM ID and

23
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:46.709
if we look to the right and
ask if we can see NTFS.

24
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.210
If we go down to 0B,
we could see our bytes per sector.

25
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.145
And they're highlighted in red there,
it's 0002, and

26
00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:02.190
remember that's going to
be read little Indian.

27
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.495
So the 02, 00.

28
00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:10.520
Right next to that highlighted in green,
we see our sectors per cluster,

29
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.561
that value is one byte long, so
we don't need to worry about indian this.

30
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:20.526
And if we go to offset 28 and
remember we're counting from the start

31
00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:24.643
of the volume boot record,
start at the data structure.

32
00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:30.844
So we go down two lines and
over eight we could see here highlighted

33
00:02:30.844 --> 00:02:35.917
in yellow is going to be our
total sectors in the volume,

34
00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:42.040
starts with EF, 6F,
OF and then 0000000000.

35
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.852
Again, that would be
read little indian and

36
00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:48.051
that will give us the total
sectors in the volume.

37
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.213
Then we see down it offset 30 and
we're talking about three lines

38
00:02:54.213 --> 00:02:59.185
down from the start of the volume
boot records, you count one, two,

39
00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:03.510
three, you can see it highlighted in pink,
it is A A, A4.

40
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.299
And remember that will be read little
indians, so that would be read A4, AA,

41
00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.158
and that will be the starting
cluster of the master file table.

42
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.128
Now in offset 38 highlighted in blue,
it starts with 02 and

43
00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:25.040
then it just has 0000 all the way
out the remainder of the bites.

44
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.994
This is starting cluster of
the master file table mirror and

45
00:03:28.994 --> 00:03:32.340
that will almost always be clustered two.

46
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.507
And again it's read little indian,
it will almost always be cluster two for

47
00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:37.491
your MFT mirror.

48
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.904
Now if we go down to offset 40, so

49
00:03:41.904 --> 00:03:46.407
you would count four lines down,
two, three,

50
00:03:46.407 --> 00:03:51.372
four, we can see our master
file table record size.

51
00:03:51.372 --> 00:03:57.547
And that is highlighted again in pink and
it starts with F6, 000000,

52
00:03:57.547 --> 00:04:02.679
again that will be read little indian and
converted to decimal.

53
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.994
We can see at offset 48 is going to
be our volume serial number and

54
00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:14.771
that is again highlighted in yellow,

55
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:19.137
four lines down eight
bytes over we see 9F,

56
00:04:19.137 --> 00:04:24.010
34, 03, 76, 70, 03, 76, B2.

57
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.521
And we would read that little indian,
and that is our volume serial number.

58
00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:32.188
And that serial number will
be unique to this volume,

59
00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.461
so we'll identify this
volume specifically.

60
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.136
We're going to do a walk through of the
volume boot record with active disk editor

61
00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:43.940
and take a look at it.

62
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.249
The items you're going to need for

63
00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:52.340
the walk through we're going to need
active disk editor and our NFTS VHD.

64
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.140
The first thing we need to
do is attach are NTFS VHD.

65
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.151
So we're going to go to disk management.

66
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.842
If you don't know where it is,
is just down in your Windows Search,

67
00:05:05.842 --> 00:05:11.041
go ahead and type in disk And
it should come up create and

68
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:17.061
format hard disks and partitions, and
that will bring up disk management.

69
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.940
Once this management is open,
we're going to go to actions attach VHD.

70
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.954
We're going to navigate out to where you
saved the VHD mine is on my desktop,

71
00:05:31.954 --> 00:05:38.551
and we're going to go ahead and attach the
NTFS VHD, click open and it will attach.

72
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.989
Once we're there,
we're going to take a look at this.

73
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:51.253
Remember the drive, the disk number and

74
00:05:51.253 --> 00:05:54.161
your volume letters.

75
00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:03.916
We want to go to the volume
that is NTFS 200 megabits,

76
00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:08.338
the second volume on the disk.

77
00:06:08.338 --> 00:06:11.111
Mine is B,
yours maybe a different drive letter.

78
00:06:11.111 --> 00:06:15.380
But this is the volume we're going to
be looking at in active disk editor.

79
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.351
So remember the disk number and
the volume letter, the volume label.

80
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.283
Okay, so now we're going to
open up active disk editor and

81
00:06:26.283 --> 00:06:28.407
we're going to say open disk.

82
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.328
We're going to look at volumes because
we're looking at our NTFS volume,

83
00:06:37.328 --> 00:06:42.840
and mine was B the second volume
in with a size of 200 mega bytes.

84
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.806
And we're going to go ahead and
click open.

85
00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:50.480
And it will open right to
the volume boot record.

86
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.178
If it did not, you can just go
to navigation, boot sector and

87
00:06:55.178 --> 00:06:58.603
that'll take you to the volume but record.

88
00:06:58.603 --> 00:07:04.851
This is in sector zero of the volume,
the logical volume, not the physical disk.

89
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.786
And we're going to take a look at
the structures we talked about in our

90
00:07:10.786 --> 00:07:11.661
PowerPoint.

91
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:19.101
And we see we have the file system
right here highlighted in green and

92
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:24.736
it is NTFS and we can see that
nasky over to the right it is NTFS.

93
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:34.840
Now we're going to take a look
at how many bytes per sector.

94
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.375
And again,
this is read little indian, so B02,

95
00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:43.285
00, and that is 512 bytes per sector.

96
00:07:43.285 --> 00:07:47.530
And then highlighted
in green at offset 0D,

97
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.556
we have sectors per cluster,
so we have eight sectors

98
00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:57.375
per cluster, and
our sector size is 512 bytes.

99
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.930
Now we want to take a look at offset 28,
and

100
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:09.600
we're going to talk about
the total sectors in the volume.

101
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.659
So we would go down two lines,
one, two, and over eight,

102
00:08:14.659 --> 00:08:20.840
and this is going to give us the total
number of sectors in our volume.

103
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.207
And again, it is read little indian,

104
00:08:25.207 --> 00:08:29.710
so it would be read from right to left and

105
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.580
it tells us the total number of sectors.

106
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.539
In this case it's 409,599.

107
00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.600
So that's how many sectors
are in this volume.

108
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.515
So that's all the data we want to
account for when we're doing our exam.

109
00:08:46.515 --> 00:08:53.395
Now we need to know the starting cluster
of the MFT, and that is down at offset 30.

110
00:08:53.395 --> 00:08:58.720
So we would count three lines down one,
two, three.

111
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.911
This is a starting cluster
of the master file table,

112
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:06.840
it starts a cluster number 17,066.

113
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.797
We go over to offset 38, and
this is the starting cluster

114
00:09:11.797 --> 00:09:16.840
of the MFT mirror, and
as we expect it is cluster two.

115
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:22.340
Again, this would be read little
indian and that would be cluster two.

116
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.322
Now we want to take a look at the MFT,
the master file table

117
00:09:27.322 --> 00:09:31.884
record size, and
that will be down at offset 40.

118
00:09:31.884 --> 00:09:37.150
And now again we're counting from
the start of the volume boot record,

119
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:43.090
the start of the data structure down
four lines, one, two, three, four.

120
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:50.149
And this is going to tell us
the clusters per file record,

121
00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:55.540
and that is F6 and we can see it is 246.

122
00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.818
Now we want to take a look at
the volume serial number and

123
00:10:00.818 --> 00:10:04.440
that would be an offset 48.

124
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:10.239
So we're already at 40, so
if we just go over to offset 48

125
00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:15.261
we can see the volume serial
number in hexadecimal.

126
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.274
And if we're going to translate that to
decimal we would need to read a little

127
00:10:21.274 --> 00:10:23.440
indian and translate it to decimal.

128
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.951
But the volume serial number
is unique to that volume.

129
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.010
So this will be helpful
to us in forensics.

130
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:37.740
Anything that identifies something
uniquely is helpful in forensics.

131
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:45.270
So that's the information that was
contained in the NTFS volume boot record,

132
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:50.300
this is where it is, and
this is how we would read it.

133
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:58.041
In our next section we are going to
talk about the master file table.

134
00:10:58.041 --> 00:10:59.361
End of block.
