00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
Welcome to InfoSec Computer
Forensics Bootcamp.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.930
My name is Denise Duffy,

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.495
you can see I have my
cellphone number up there.

4
00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:12.350
I'm going to be your instructor
for this learning path.

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.420
I have a background
in law enforcement,

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.430
I was part of an ICAC unit,

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.470
Internet Crimes Against Children.

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.415
I did digital and
mobile forensics,

9
00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:27.240
I handled cases such as child
exploitation, narcotics,

10
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.850
suicide, sexual
assault, homicide,

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.370
home invasion, theft,
missing persons.

12
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.290
I've handled a variety
of different cases.

13
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.825
I also have handled
some fraud cases.

14
00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:40.860
After I retired, I work
in the private sector for

15
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.100
CyforTec Group and
we handle a lot of

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.580
IP theft cases for
major companies,

17
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.205
we handle intrusion cases and
a variety of civil cases.

18
00:00:53.205 --> 00:00:56.175
I work both in the public
and private sectors.

19
00:00:56.175 --> 00:01:00.255
Our learning objectives for
this path is we're going to

20
00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:02.130
come to understand
what it means to have

21
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.965
a mindset of a computer
forensic examiner.

22
00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:07.710
We're going to
understand the methods

23
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.695
we use when we're
doing the examination,

24
00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:15.015
why they are so important and
how they are useful to us.

25
00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:19.500
We're going to develop skills
that most examiners have.

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.360
We're going to expose you to

27
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.690
a wide variety of forensic
tools and techniques,

28
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.540
we're going to show you
some advanced concepts,

29
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.355
you're going to
get some exposure.

30
00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.870
We're going to prepare you for

31
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.180
further study in the
forensics field,

32
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.655
because this will not
be your last course.

33
00:01:35.655 --> 00:01:39.615
We're also going to prepare
you for the CCFE exam.

34
00:01:39.615 --> 00:01:42.630
A little bit about this course,

35
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.975
it is not an expert level
computer forensics course,

36
00:01:45.975 --> 00:01:47.190
this is the beginning,
we're going

37
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.390
to touch on everything,

38
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.850
but we're really not going to
get to dive into too much.

39
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.900
This is a foundations course,

40
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.040
we need to start,

41
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.820
we need to walk
before we can run.

42
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.310
We're going to touch on

43
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.050
everything a computer forensic
examiner needs to know.

44
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.480
This is a great overview

45
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.085
of everything we're going to see,

46
00:02:05.085 --> 00:02:06.630
but additional study beyond

47
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.725
this course is going
to be required.

48
00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:12.585
The best way to learn computer
forensics is by doing,

49
00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:16.110
hands-on, and active
participation.

50
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.840
A little bit more about
our certification exam,

51
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.590
the certifying body,

52
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.470
the people that issued
the certificate is

53
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.740
the IACRB in the Certified
Computer Forensic Examiner,

54
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.890
the CCFE test.

55
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.490
It's going to test your
fundamental knowledge

56
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.900
of computer forensics,

57
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.710
evidence recovery in
the analysis process.

58
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.390
You're going to be evaluated on

59
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.315
your knowledge of both
the hard and soft skills,

60
00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:47.580
you're going to be tested
on the soft skills,

61
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.570
you've got to prove that you have

62
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.535
the requisite
background knowledge of

63
00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:53.350
the complex legal issues that are

64
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.510
related to the computer
forensics field.

65
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.250
It's going to be multiple choice,

66
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.550
50 questions, you must get
a passing score of 70,

67
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.590
you have a time
duration of two hours,

68
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.145
so there is a time limit,

69
00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:08.755
but it's plenty of time
don't worry about it

70
00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:11.875
and the test's format
in multiple-choice.

71
00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:16.435
There's no essays or hands
on practical in this test.

72
00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:19.640
Let's get started.
