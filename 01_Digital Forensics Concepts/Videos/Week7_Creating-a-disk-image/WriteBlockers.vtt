00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
Welcome back to the
Computer Forensics Path.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.180
In this course, we're talking

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.225
about creating a forensic image.

4
00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:11.340
In Module 3 of this course,

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.890
we're going to talk
about write blockers.

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.889
Now, hardware write blockers,

7
00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:20.295
which are the ones you
really want to try to use,

8
00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.760
they have firmware
to prevent writes.

9
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.680
So there's built-in firmware

10
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.105
inside the hardware
write blockers.

11
00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:31.220
This firmware does not depend on

12
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.720
our operating system or
a BIOS to block writes.

13
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.075
It is independent of
our operating system.

14
00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:41.660
It is effective in

15
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.964
modern Windows and other
operating systems.

16
00:00:44.964 --> 00:00:49.085
Software write
blockers by contrast,

17
00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:52.790
they do work in a
Dos environment with

18
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.180
the intercept 13 of the BIOS
command for the writes,

19
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.074
but they will not work in a
modern Windows environment.

20
00:01:02.074 --> 00:01:08.695
They can be effective in
stopping writes to USB ports.

21
00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:12.665
You always want to test
these write blockers because

22
00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:16.230
I've downloaded quite a few
of them and tested them,

23
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.800
and some of them simply
just don't work,

24
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.765
or they don't work on
a particular drive

25
00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:23.020
that you're trying
to use them on.

26
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.460
They're not reliable for

27
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.015
the most part and we'll
talk more about that.

28
00:01:30.015 --> 00:01:34.340
Now, there are some paid
software write blockers

29
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.780
that will work in

30
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.015
modern Windows and
they're listed up here.

31
00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:39.665
There is Safe Block,

32
00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:42.215
which will work in a
modern Windows system,

33
00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:44.960
and there is FastBloc SE,

34
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.205
which is an add-on
module to EnCase.

35
00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:52.810
EnCase is an
examination software.

36
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.870
Now there are some software

37
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.480
write blockers that
will work on USB ports,

38
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.400
I have two of them
listed up here.

39
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.175
There are more out there and
I would recommend again,

40
00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:05.960
testing and validating whatever

41
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.400
you download to make sure it

42
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.020
is going to work before you

43
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.075
use it on any type of evidence.

44
00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:13.730
But we have Thumbscrews and

45
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.895
USB write blocker
for all Windows,

46
00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:18.950
and as the name says,

47
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.000
it work is in a
Windows environment.

48
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.610
Always test a software write

49
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.805
blocker before you
use it on evidence,

50
00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:32.370
I cannot say that enough.

51
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.465
We're going to do a demo of
a write blocker validation.

52
00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:41.420
If you would like to follow

53
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.010
along the items you're
going to need, are,

54
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.610
you're going to need
the program called

55
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.850
Thumbscrews and a USB device.

56
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.480
The URL for Thumbscrews
is in the slide.

57
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.285
Remember go ahead
and download it,

58
00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:59.570
and then you'll have to
extract it, it's a zip file.

59
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.760
Start Thumbscrews before
connecting the USB device.

60
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.845
Because how this particular
piece of software works,

61
00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:09.940
is it will not block

62
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.275
the USB devices you

63
00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:13.750
already have plugged
into your computer.

64
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.310
Once you turn it on,

65
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.920
it only blocks new
USB connections.

66
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.205
So make sure that you activate it

67
00:03:21.205 --> 00:03:24.565
before you connect
the USB device.

68
00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:27.730
If you have a
small-capacity USB device,

69
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.260
that's what we want to use,

70
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.080
the smaller the better
because it goes faster.

71
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.705
Let's get started
with our software,

72
00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:39.640
USB Write Blocker validation.

73
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.845
The first thing we're
going to need to do,

74
00:03:41.845 --> 00:03:45.420
is download USB Write
Blocker for all Windows,

75
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.660
the URL should be in

76
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.070
your class handout or
it is in the video.

77
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.930
Once you've navigated
to the site,

78
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.825
go ahead and click ''Download''.

79
00:03:56.825 --> 00:03:58.760
Make sure you're downloading

80
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.355
USB Write Blocker All Windows.

81
00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:03.875
The download will start
in a couple of seconds.

82
00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:05.749
Once the download's complete,

83
00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:07.260
it's going to be a zip file,

84
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.555
so go ahead and save it
wherever you'd like to.

85
00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:12.140
Once you've saved it,

86
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.075
go ahead and extract it.

87
00:04:14.075 --> 00:04:15.220
I'm going to use 7-Zip.

88
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.290
I would recommend using
7-Zip to extract it.

89
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.165
I'm just going to
extract it here.

90
00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:21.920
Once it extracts, you'll

91
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.185
see a file
USB_Write_Blocker_All_Windows.bat.

92
00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:30.120
It's a batch file and that's
what we're going to use.

93
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.720
Go ahead and double-click
on that and it will open.

94
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.320
Once it opens, it's
very simple to use.

95
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.835
If we want to turn it on,

96
00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:39.874
what you do is you type a one,

97
00:04:39.874 --> 00:04:41.680
then "Enter", and then it'll

98
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.040
prompt you to type
''Enter'' one more time.

99
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.789
To turn it off, you
simply type a two,

100
00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.830
"Enter", and then
it will also prompt

101
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.335
you to type ''Enter''
one more time.

102
00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:55.325
To exit, simply type the
number 3 and "Enter".

103
00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:56.900
We're going to go
ahead and turn it on.

104
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.815
I'm going to type a one, "Enter",

105
00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:00.280
and it's going to tell
you, it's going to

106
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.025
make a change to your registry.

107
00:05:02.025 --> 00:05:04.055
That's how it
prevents the writes.

108
00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:07.215
Then you have to type
''Enter'' again to continue.

109
00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:10.555
Now, it will tell you the
USB write blocker is on.

110
00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:12.865
At this point is when
we're going to plug

111
00:05:12.865 --> 00:05:15.200
our test thumb drive,

112
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.540
our test USB device in.

113
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.765
Do not plug the USB device
in before you turn this on.

114
00:05:22.765 --> 00:05:25.660
If you do, it will not work.

115
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.215
Now that it's on, we're going
to plug in our USB device.

116
00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:31.655
We can see when we plug
in the USB device,

117
00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:35.185
these are the files that
are on my USB device.

118
00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:36.595
Now I want to bring up

119
00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:40.985
FTK Imager because we are
going to hash this device.

120
00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:42.645
But before we do that,

121
00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:45.810
notice the drive letter is M.

122
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.010
Bring up Disk
Management because we

123
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.970
want the actual disk number,

124
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.210
not just the logical volume.

125
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.075
My logical volume is going to be

126
00:05:56.075 --> 00:06:00.260
M. My physical disk is Disk 13.

127
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.380
When I create this hash value,

128
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.070
I want to hash the physical disk,

129
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.860
not the logical volume.

130
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.840
Whatever yours is,
it'll probably be

131
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.630
different than it
is on my computer,

132
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.255
but make a note of the
drive letter for the volume

133
00:06:14.255 --> 00:06:16.660
and the number of the physical
disk you're going to be

134
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.660
looking for when
we use FTK Imager.

135
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.460
Now go ahead and
launch FTK Imager.

136
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.420
I'm going to go to ''File'',
''Add Evidence Item''.

137
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.100
We're going to use a physical
drive, click "Next".

138
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.440
From the drop-down box,

139
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.575
select your USB device.

140
00:06:33.575 --> 00:06:36.530
Mine was Physical Drive 13,

141
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.955
yours could be different,

142
00:06:37.955 --> 00:06:39.540
and then we're going
to click "Finish".

143
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.070
Now, we can take a look
at what we have here.

144
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.660
When I look at the
root of the volume,

145
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.930
I can see the same files I
saw on Windows Explorer.

146
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.885
I want to hash this
physical disk.

147
00:06:51.885 --> 00:06:54.440
I'm going to highlight
the physical disk.

148
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.780
Do not highlight
the logical volume,

149
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.465
you'll get a
different hash value.

150
00:06:58.465 --> 00:07:00.675
Make sure you're highlighting
the physical drive.

151
00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:04.830
Click "File", "Verify
Drive Image",

152
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.885
then it will start working.

153
00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:10.425
Now it is hashing
our physical disk,

154
00:07:10.425 --> 00:07:12.615
and because my test
drive is small,

155
00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:14.835
which is what you want
for your test devices,

156
00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:16.625
it goes very quickly.

157
00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:21.250
It gives you the physical drive
number, how many sectors,

158
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.945
an MD5 hash value,

159
00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:25.720
a SHA1 hash value,

160
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.640
and it also notes that it did
not find any bad sectors.

161
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.800
This is called the pre-hash,

162
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.560
and we're going to do this before

163
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.605
we attempt to write to the drive.

164
00:07:34.605 --> 00:07:37.275
Now you need to document
your pre-hash because

165
00:07:37.275 --> 00:07:40.075
Imager will not save this
information for you.

166
00:07:40.075 --> 00:07:42.540
I like to use the snipping tool.

167
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.335
You can do a screenshot,

168
00:07:44.335 --> 00:07:45.835
however you want to do it,

169
00:07:45.835 --> 00:07:47.630
but make sure you document it.

170
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:54.125
I'm just going to save this
as usb_testdrive_pre-hash.

171
00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:56.545
I'll just leave it on
my desktop for now.

172
00:07:56.545 --> 00:07:58.610
Now I'm going to go
ahead and minimize that.

173
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.990
I'm going to close this.

174
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.055
I'm going to remove
my evidence item

175
00:08:02.055 --> 00:08:04.780
and I'm going to
close FTK Imager.

176
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.480
The reason I'm doing that
is I don't want Imager to

177
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.160
read from a cache file,

178
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.895
I want it to re-hash my
drive when I'm done.

179
00:08:13.895 --> 00:08:16.455
So go ahead and close FTK Imager.

180
00:08:16.455 --> 00:08:18.890
Now we're going to bring
up Windows Explorer

181
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.465
and try to write
to our test drive.

182
00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:23.025
I have Windows Explorer.

183
00:08:23.025 --> 00:08:24.305
This is my test drive,

184
00:08:24.305 --> 00:08:29.410
USB Test Drive M. My volume
label is USB Test Drive.

185
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.330
I'd recommend using
a volume label

186
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.070
that you're going to recognize.

187
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.255
Let's try to make
some changes here.

188
00:08:35.255 --> 00:08:37.030
I'm going to write, this is

189
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:42.755
a USB software
writeblock validation.

190
00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.990
It doesn't really
matter what you write.

191
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.990
What we're trying to do here is

192
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.205
show that we cannot
write to the drive.

193
00:08:49.205 --> 00:08:51.775
I'm going to try to
save it to the drive.

194
00:08:51.775 --> 00:08:53.760
I immediately get a
message that says I

195
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.990
can't save to this
particular drive.

196
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.475
Now you'd also want
to document this.

197
00:08:58.475 --> 00:09:01.520
I'm just going to use a
screenshot to do that.

198
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.240
It won't let me do that
so I'm going to cancel.

199
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.890
Close that file.

200
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:11.665
Don't save. Now let me
try to delete something.

201
00:09:11.665 --> 00:09:16.185
Well, it doesn't even give
you the option to delete.

202
00:09:16.185 --> 00:09:20.205
I'm going to try a
Control-X to delete.

203
00:09:20.205 --> 00:09:24.525
I want to cut it. It
won't let me do that.

204
00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:27.285
Bring up a post-hash here.

205
00:09:27.285 --> 00:09:28.650
I'll try to edit it,

206
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.520
close it, and it
is not saving it.

207
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.140
We can try it again.

208
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.440
I'll draw again.

209
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.110
Save a copy.

210
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.155
I'm going to try to save it to M,

211
00:09:52.155 --> 00:09:54.900
and again it's telling
me I can't save to

212
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.630
drive M. I could save
that somewhere else,

213
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:03.075
but I cannot write to the
right protected drive.

214
00:10:03.075 --> 00:10:04.590
It is right protecting

215
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.680
my USB test drive which is
what it's supposed to do.

216
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.160
I'll just close that,

217
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.645
and if I reopen it,

218
00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:15.480
you can see it did
not save the changes.

219
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.240
Let me try to add
something to it.

220
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.910
I'll just bring up anything

221
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.140
and I'll just try
to add this PDF.

222
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.435
Copy to test drive

223
00:10:27.435 --> 00:10:31.330
and it's telling me my
disk is write-protected,

224
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.290
that I cannot add
any data to this.

225
00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.205
Let me go ahead and take
another screenshot.

226
00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:39.570
When you're doing this, you do

227
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.070
want to document what you did.

228
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.465
You tried to write to it,

229
00:10:42.465 --> 00:10:44.055
you tried to erase something,

230
00:10:44.055 --> 00:10:45.945
you tried to alter something,

231
00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.730
and you were unable to do so.

232
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.220
Now that I've tried to alter

233
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.160
data on the drive or tried
to write to that drive,

234
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.295
I'm going to go ahead and
bring up FTK Imager again,

235
00:10:56.295 --> 00:10:58.410
and I'm going to add
the driver again.

236
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.005
So File, Add Evidence Item.

237
00:11:01.005 --> 00:11:03.165
We're looking for
a physical drive.

238
00:11:03.165 --> 00:11:08.460
I'm going to select my USB
drive minus physical drive 13.

239
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.620
Yours will probably be different.

240
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.220
Click "Finish" and I can take

241
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.895
a look just to make sure I'm
looking at the same drive,

242
00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:22.620
and I see the files that we
saw on Windows Explorer.

243
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.860
Now make sure you
highlight Physical Drive.

244
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:31.950
I'm going to go to File,
Verify Drive/Image.

245
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.230
It has completed.

246
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.490
Once it's completed,

247
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.560
I'm going to compare my results.

248
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.350
This would be considered
your post-hash.

249
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.870
We do a pre-hash and a post-hash.

250
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.720
Let me bring up my pre-hash
and I'm going to look at

251
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.800
the hash values and
they do in fact match.

252
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.530
Now what you would do
here is I go and click

253
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:57.615
"New" and I would take
a snapshot of this,

254
00:11:57.615 --> 00:12:01.125
and I would save
it File, Save As,

255
00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:05.520
and I'm going to call this my
"USB test drive post-hash."

256
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.205
I'm just going to leave it
as desktop and save it.

257
00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:11.910
Now what you would want to
do is you would want to take

258
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.240
all the documentation and put it

259
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:20.235
into a single report, PDF.

260
00:12:20.235 --> 00:12:22.695
Whoever you want to save
that documentation,

261
00:12:22.695 --> 00:12:24.060
you'd want to make sure you wrote

262
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.625
the date and time
that you did this,

263
00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:28.770
and you'd want to
keep a record of

264
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.185
all your validations so that

265
00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:33.630
if you're ever going into court,

266
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.645
civil, criminal, or just
an internal hearing,

267
00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:38.985
whatever type of
investigation you're doing,

268
00:12:38.985 --> 00:12:42.090
you could show documentation
that you did in fact

269
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.240
validate your software before

270
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.760
you used it on the
original evidence.

271
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.665
With a software right blocker,

272
00:12:49.665 --> 00:12:52.575
I would validate it
before each use.

273
00:12:52.575 --> 00:12:54.750
With the hardware write blocker,

274
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.445
you do not have to do that.

275
00:12:56.445 --> 00:12:59.610
Now I've done that and I'm done.

276
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:05.140
I want to go ahead and
eject my USB drive.

277
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:11.130
Remember to eject your USB
drive. Hang on just a second.

278
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.180
You're going to have to remove

279
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.100
the evidence item and close

280
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.100
FTK Imager before you're
able to eject that drive.

281
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.350
Now I want to eject my drive

282
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.995
before I turn off
USB write blocker.

283
00:13:25.995 --> 00:13:28.680
I've ejected my drive.

284
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.870
Now I want to go ahead and
turn off USB write blocker.

285
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:39.930
To do that, we're going to
type the Number 2 to disable,

286
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.570
and we're going to type "Enter",

287
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.970
and it's going to again
prompt you that it

288
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.814
is going to make a
change to your registry,

289
00:13:46.814 --> 00:13:49.620
I'm going to click "Yes" and now

290
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.875
we must press "Enter" again
or any key to continue,

291
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:56.370
and now USB write
blocker is turned off.

292
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.869
In our next module,

293
00:13:57.869 --> 00:14:00.060
we're going to talk
about creating

294
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.285
and validating forensic images.

295
00:14:03.285 --> 00:14:05.950
End of demonstration.
