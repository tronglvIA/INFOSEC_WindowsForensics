00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.505
Hello and welcome back to
the Windows forensics path.

2
00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.130
In this course, we're
going to be talking

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.085
about creating a disk image.

4
00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:13.950
Throughout this course,
we're going to be talking

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.055
about sterilizing
our target media.

6
00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.550
Making sure our
target media is clean

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.770
before we add our
evidence files to it.

8
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.415
We'll talk about
validating our tools,

9
00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:27.030
making sure that the
tools we're going to

10
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.580
use are functioning properly.

11
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.175
We'll talk about write blockers,

12
00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:33.465
how we use them,

13
00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:34.980
and why we use them.

14
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.200
We're going to talk
about creating and

15
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.955
validating a forensic image.

16
00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:41.840
How we create the image,

17
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.180
and how we go about
validating to show

18
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.075
that there were no changes
made to the original evidence.

19
00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:50.375
We're going to talk about the dd,

20
00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:56.240
dcfldd commands which are
used to create a disk image.

21
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.625
In module 1 of this course,

22
00:00:58.625 --> 00:00:59.990
we're going to talk about how we

23
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.940
sterilize our target media.

24
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.650
Why do we use sterile media
for our evidence collection?

25
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.800
Well, we want to
ensure that there is

26
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.355
no pre-existing data
on the target drive.

27
00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:20.210
We want to make sure
that the device we're

28
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.010
copying our evidence to is

29
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.410
completely free of
any other data.

30
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.200
We do this to avoid
cross-contamination,

31
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.820
to make sure that
there's no other data

32
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.230
on there that does not

33
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.770
belong to our
forensic disk image.

34
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.910
When would we want to
use sterile media?

35
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.460
We always want to use

36
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.940
sterile media when we're
collecting evidence.

37
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.850
When you're copying your
forensic image files

38
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.220
to your evidence drives.

39
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.250
Now we have to take a few
things into consideration.

40
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.070
One thing is that
deleting a file,

41
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.320
as we've seen
throughout this path,

42
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.810
does not necessarily
remove data from

43
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.280
the drive so we

44
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.330
can't just delete all
the data on the drive,

45
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.905
we have to actually
forensically wipe the drive.

46
00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:18.095
Also formatting a drive

47
00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:21.100
does not remove all the
data from the drive.

48
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.365
New drives that you
buy at the store,

49
00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:26.540
they usually have
some data on them,

50
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.795
they're going to be formatted
with a file system.

51
00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:31.760
They also usually have

52
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.900
some type of data from
the manufacturer.

53
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.110
Remember, never
trust, always wipe.

54
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.620
If somebody gives
you a drive and asks

55
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.865
you to copy some
data on it for them,

56
00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:49.640
always tell them that
you are going to wipe

57
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.680
the drive before you

58
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.610
copy the evidence
files to the drive,

59
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.025
never trust, always wipe.

60
00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:02.240
When we're doing our
forensic disk wiping,

61
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.710
we want to have

62
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.080
a constant output and

63
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.965
we want something that's
going to be reproducible.

64
00:03:08.965 --> 00:03:13.430
What we do is we write
the disk using all zeros.

65
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.280
This will give us the
same result every time,

66
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.615
and we would verify that
with a checksum 64,

67
00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:23.995
and we're going to do
that in our walk through.

68
00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:26.105
The tools we're going
to need for our

69
00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:29.815
walk-through: we're
going to need Kill disk.

70
00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:32.775
We're going to need HXD,

71
00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:37.360
and we're going to need a small
capacity USB flash drive.

72
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.945
Okay, we're going to do a
sterile media walk-through.

73
00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:44.885
We are going to forensically wipe

74
00:03:44.885 --> 00:03:48.230
our target media and
then verify the wipe.

75
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.540
The drive I'm going to wipe is

76
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.090
this one I've labeled
target media.

77
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.040
I highly recommend that you label

78
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.340
your target drives something
specific so you can

79
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.770
ensure you're wiping the
correct drive because you

80
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.785
don't want to wipe an
evidence drive by mistake.

81
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.485
Once we've opened up
active kill disk,

82
00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:09.080
we're going to locate our
drive, minus right here,

83
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.685
target media drive letter
F, physical disk 10,

84
00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:17.185
yours may be different and
probably will be different,

85
00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:19.820
so make sure you're
on the correct drive.

86
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.010
Once you're there,
you just select it,

87
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.845
and you can simply select
it by clicking on it.

88
00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:28.040
Now it's going to
describe it over here.

89
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.900
On the right-hand side,

90
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.430
it'll tell you the size,

91
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.650
the free-space, the
allocated space.

92
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.855
It'll just give you some
of the drive geometry.

93
00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:37.445
So once you're sure you're wiping

94
00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:39.890
the correct drive with kill disk,

95
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.255
you're going to select it.

96
00:04:41.255 --> 00:04:42.650
You're going to
select to wipe the

97
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.910
entire drive so you want to make

98
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.600
sure the whole thing
is yellow over here.

99
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.185
The whole thing should
be highlighted,

100
00:04:48.185 --> 00:04:49.610
the entire drive,
and you're going

101
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.590
to select ''Erase disk''.

102
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.740
Now make sure you're selecting

103
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.745
''Erase disk'',
not ''Wipe disk''.

104
00:04:54.745 --> 00:04:58.455
Wipe disk does not
white the entire drive,

105
00:04:58.455 --> 00:05:01.520
it just wipes unused
data from partition,

106
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.750
so it just cleans up your desk.

107
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.970
Want to make sure you're
selecting Erase disk.

108
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.350
Once you've done
that, it's going to

109
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.925
show you the drive you're wiping,

110
00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:10.745
you're going to select
all disk space.

111
00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:13.549
We can go with one pass zeros,

112
00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:16.730
we're not going to verify the
erasure with this program,

113
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.870
we're going to use
a separate one.

114
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.180
We're not going to
initialize the disk

115
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.655
after erasure because
we want to confirm

116
00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.335
the disk has been
completely erased

117
00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:27.460
before we initialize it,
we're going to hit ''Start''.

118
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.375
It's going to ask you to confirm,

119
00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:32.255
you have to type this in
all caps, erase all data.

120
00:05:32.255 --> 00:05:34.970
Once you've done that, you
can click ''Okay'' and this

121
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.880
is a very small drive so it
should wipe fairly quickly.

122
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.860
Once the drive is wiped,

123
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.870
you will get a message saying

124
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.120
either success or that
there were some errors.

125
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.620
If there are errors,
you need to check.

126
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.975
It does have a log,

127
00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:48.750
and it also have a results pane.

128
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.160
Now that we've done that,

129
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.910
we can go ahead and
get rid of this.

130
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.580
Now what we're going to do is use

131
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.150
HDX to verify that our
driver has been wiped,

132
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.385
and we're going to
use a checksum 64.

133
00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:05.610
If we wipe the disk
with all zeros,

134
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.675
our checksum 64
should be all zeros.

135
00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:11.015
Once we've opened HDX,

136
00:06:11.015 --> 00:06:13.520
make sure you are running
in as Admin or you

137
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.510
won't be able to open disk,

138
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.705
and we're going to
select our drive.

139
00:06:18.705 --> 00:06:22.805
We want to select the physical
disk, minus down here,

140
00:06:22.805 --> 00:06:25.505
removable disk 1, it has the size

141
00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:28.490
but the drive label is gone
because we wiped the drive.

142
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.140
Select your drive and click
''Okay'' and it will open up.

143
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.220
Now what we want to
do is we want to

144
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.410
perform our checksum 64.

145
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.395
So we're going to go
to analysis checksums

146
00:06:39.395 --> 00:06:42.425
and we're going to
select checksum 64,

147
00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:44.730
and we're going to
click ''Okay'' and

148
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.960
because my target drive is small,

149
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.250
it will run quickly.

150
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.265
This will take a lot longer
on a full-size drive.

151
00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:53.850
We can see the results,

152
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.610
my checksum 64 is

153
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.705
all zeros which is what
I expected it to be.

154
00:06:58.705 --> 00:07:02.600
Now I would want to copy that
out or take a screenshot of

155
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.860
my checksum results to

156
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.305
verify that I've wiped
my target drive,

157
00:07:06.305 --> 00:07:07.990
I would want to document
that somewhere.

158
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.650
Now once your target
driver is wiped,

159
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.230
you can go ahead and
format it, and relabel it,

160
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.570
something that you will
recognize when you plug it into

161
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.155
the suspect's computer as
being your target drive.

162
00:07:17.155 --> 00:07:20.840
That is the end of
our walkthrough on

163
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.790
how to sterilize our
target media before use.

164
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.480
In our next section,

165
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.270
we are going to be
talking about validating

166
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.780
our forensic tools in our
next module, end of block.
