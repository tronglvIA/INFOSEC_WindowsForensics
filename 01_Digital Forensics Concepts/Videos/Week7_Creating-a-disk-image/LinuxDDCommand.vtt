00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.930
Welcome back to the computer
forensics path.

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:10.440
And this course course 11 we're talking
about creating a forensic image.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.140
This is actually acquiring our disk image.

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.340
We've covered sterilizing
our target media.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.614
We talked about validating our tools.

6
00:00:20.614 --> 00:00:25.619
We've talked about creating
a clone have a hard drive and

7
00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.904
we also talked about
creating a forensic image.

8
00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:35.186
In this module,
module five, we're going to

9
00:00:35.186 --> 00:00:40.480
talk about using the DG
in D CFLDD commands.

10
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.564
Now let's talk about the syntax
of the Lennox DD command.

11
00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:53.126
DD the IF that we're going to use
to execute this command stands for

12
00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:55.140
input file.

13
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.673
This is the file that we're copying and

14
00:00:57.673 --> 00:01:02.203
this is very important to remember
because if you confuse the input and

15
00:01:02.203 --> 00:01:05.761
the output file you're going to
override the evidence.

16
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.661
The OF is the output file.

17
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.151
This is where we're writing
the evidence to our target media.

18
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.361
This is what we would have sterilized.

19
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.561
And OF stands for output file.

20
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.370
DD stands for just duplicate.

21
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.540
So we're duplicating a disk,
we're creating a forensic image.

22
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.276
We need to tell the software
the program what

23
00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:44.530
file we're copying and
we were copying it to.

24
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.037
So what dr are we copying And
this works on a full disk or

25
00:01:49.037 --> 00:01:51.551
it would work on a partition.

26
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.914
But we have to tell it
what we're copying and

27
00:01:55.914 --> 00:02:01.740
where we're copying it to to create
a duplicate copy of a partition.

28
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.740
And we're talking about using Lennox.

29
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.843
We're going to use the pseudo so
we can get permission if you're

30
00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:15.721
not already locked in his room then
we'd use the DD for just duplicate I F.

31
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:23.219
For our input file and we have the equal
sign and then the path to the input file.

32
00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.332
In this we're copying
a petition sda one and

33
00:02:27.332 --> 00:02:33.840
then the output file Is going to
be in a directory called Case one.

34
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.161
And I'm naming that file disc a one
dot tv now to copy the physical disk.

35
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.402
But again, we would need to use the Sudo
command if we weren't route D D and

36
00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:55.113
then our input file is going to be S D,
a s D b, S D C,

37
00:02:55.113 --> 00:03:01.640
depending on what you know what
dr letter we are mounted as.

38
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.440
So it would be S D and
then A B, C, D E etcetera.

39
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.630
And then the output file again,
we're going to tell the directory and

40
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.561
the file name.

41
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.697
Now, if you happen to be in the directory
that you want to copy this to,

42
00:03:19.697 --> 00:03:22.777
you don't have to put a directory,

43
00:03:22.777 --> 00:03:28.031
you can just put the file new
now the list of disk partitions.

44
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:29.871
Because we're going to need
to list the partition.

45
00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:34.320
So we make sure that we are using
the right input file and

46
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.140
the right output file.

47
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.046
And there are some commands
we could use here,

48
00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:45.161
we could use pseudo,
we could use f disk minus L.

49
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.061
We could use the L S B L K or
we can use Mt.

50
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.751
So we want to list the partitions,
locate our drives, make sure it works.

51
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.761
Have the correct output input files.

52
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.240
Now, D C F L D D.

53
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.851
We can create a forensic evidence
file with a verification value.

54
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.940
Yeah.

55
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.661
So we can do our MD five and
our shore one with D C F L D D.

56
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.159
Now in this particular command we
are asking for the MD five hash but

57
00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.561
you can ask for the shore one as well.

58
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.323
But when you look at this command,
it is the MD five hash that will

59
00:04:37.323 --> 00:04:41.051
automatically be created when
we execute this command.

60
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.343
And again, our input file would
be in our device folder and

61
00:04:48.343 --> 00:04:52.249
then it would be S T A, R, S, D, B or C or

62
00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:58.140
whatever it is mounted as And
then her output file.

63
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.476
This is simply put in
the home directory and

64
00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:09.831
than it has to file name now hash we're
telling it we want to hash so half.

65
00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:15.572
And I'm saying equals MD five and
then we have to have a hash

66
00:05:15.572 --> 00:05:21.920
law where we're writing this hash out too,
so hash log equals.

67
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.934
And then the file path in
the file name to where we want to

68
00:05:26.934 --> 00:05:32.820
output are hash log and
again to list the partitions in the disk,

69
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.951
including the size we can use
our f disk minus L command.

70
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.239
There is another command we can use and
this is newer and

71
00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:48.145
I really like the way this one works
better And we're going to get to see that

72
00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:52.811
when we go through our demo,
we'll walk through each one of these and

73
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:57.251
I'll show you the output it gives,
but it's called DC three DD.

74
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.851
And with DC three DD.

75
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:09.461
We can create our hash values
the same as we did in D c f L D G.

76
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.341
But the command is just
easier to write and

77
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:16.101
the information it gives
us is more robust.

78
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:18.440
We get more information.

79
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.500
You'll get about the same information
as you would with fbK immature, you're

80
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.940
going to get the time it started, you're
going to get how many bytes it copied.

81
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.261
You're going to get a lot of information
and we'll see this way do I walk through.

82
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.971
So the command works pretty much
the same way It starts with DC three DD.

83
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:43.033
Because that is the program that
we're running our input file,

84
00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:46.861
which is going to equal deaf for device.

85
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.344
and then this one happens to be STB but
it could be Akkad depends

86
00:06:53.344 --> 00:07:00.040
on what drives you want to image and
where the file system mounted it.

87
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.040
And then we have hohf,
which is a little different.

88
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.340
HDs for hash and
o F stands for output file.

89
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.878
So we're hash of the output file and

90
00:07:13.878 --> 00:07:17.540
that equals STD dot i M G.

91
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.251
And that's what I'm naming the image.

92
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.059
I'll profile with a hash value
is going to be STB dot i m G And

93
00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:31.740
I have half equals empty
five Passion Equal Shaw one.

94
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.954
So I'm doing an MD five and
assure one with this command and

95
00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:40.951
now I'm going to output it to a log and
it says log equals hash dot txt.

96
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.730
That's what I'm naming my log.

97
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.240
Hashtag txt Okay.

98
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.140
Mhm.

99
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.810
By default it will write this hash log.

100
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.741
If I do not put a file path in here, it's
going to write it and whatever folder I'm

101
00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:59.651
in in terminal and we'll see that
when we do our walk through.

102
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.490
Okay.
We're going to do our demo now of our

103
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.370
three commands that we talked about.

104
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.481
The DD command, the D C F L D.

105
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:15.756
D command In the DC three DD command,
We're going to do a demonstration and

106
00:08:15.756 --> 00:08:22.070
this is a demonstration only because I'm
running it on a Lennox virtual machine.

107
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:27.340
If you do have the Lennox VM and you want
to follow along at home, That's great.

108
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:32.275
The commands we're going
to be using are going

109
00:08:32.275 --> 00:08:35.580
to be D D D C F L D D and D C three D D.

110
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.966
And these are the commands we
talked about for imaging a drive,

111
00:08:39.966 --> 00:08:42.809
full drive or logical volume in Lennox.

112
00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:43.660
Now the D.

113
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.080
D command will image the drive.

114
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.331
The syntax of the command is D.

115
00:08:48.331 --> 00:08:49.040
D.

116
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.991
And then we have our input file I.

117
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:51.615
F.
And

118
00:08:51.615 --> 00:08:53.670
we have to give it the path to the drive.

119
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.281
So this is DEv STB is
the path to the drive.

120
00:08:57.281 --> 00:08:59.690
We're going to image now the output file.

121
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.680
I'm putting it in this folder
on my desktop called task.

122
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.958
So it would be home my name because
I'm the user desktop test and

123
00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:13.860
I'm calling it flash drive dot
I M G flash drive dot image.

124
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.967
Now when I do this, but
before I would do this,

125
00:09:16.967 --> 00:09:19.780
let's back up just a minute for a second.

126
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.489
You probably want to if you were
doing this on the system and

127
00:09:23.489 --> 00:09:28.637
you were doing it live before you created
the image, you would want to go ahead and

128
00:09:28.637 --> 00:09:32.680
list your blocks out and
take a look at what you wanted to image.

129
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.050
So let's list the blocks
out to list the blocks out.

130
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:42.140
I'm going to use the LS for
list and then B L K for list block.

131
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:49.332
Now we do this, we can see all
the drives that can be mounted here and

132
00:09:49.332 --> 00:09:56.040
I see my STB,
I can see how big it is, it's 120 MB.

133
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.935
It is my USB test drive and
that is the one

134
00:09:59.935 --> 00:10:04.671
that I want to create a DVD
image of the command.

135
00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:08.990
Again, D D for dis duplicate.

136
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.713
I.
F is the input file and

137
00:10:10.713 --> 00:10:14.494
we're pointing it at this
S D B O F is the output file and

138
00:10:14.494 --> 00:10:18.380
I'm going to output to this
test folder on my desktop.

139
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.115
Now when I hit enter,
it's going to take a second to run and

140
00:10:22.115 --> 00:10:26.250
it's already finished and
it tells you how many records in and

141
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.460
how many records out
that number should match.

142
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:34.476
It tells you how many bytes that it copied
and it gives us you in megabytes also,

143
00:10:34.476 --> 00:10:37.820
but it is not automatically
creating a hash value.

144
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.140
If we go and look in our test folder,
we can see our flash drive dot image.

145
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.270
Now D c F L d D.

146
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:50.834
We can create a MD five and
sha one image if we'd like,

147
00:10:50.834 --> 00:10:55.820
as we're creating the image itself and
it runs that fast.

148
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.640
So let's take a look at the command.

149
00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.560
It's D C F L D D again,
our input file, which is the same.

150
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.482
It's in the devices and
it's STB I asked for

151
00:11:07.482 --> 00:11:12.403
a hash MD five and
sha one I output in my MD five

152
00:11:12.403 --> 00:11:16.560
to MD five log equals MD five dot txt.

153
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.011
The MD five log is what it's creating and
I have to give it a file name.

154
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:25.640
The show one log is the same show
one log equals shaw one dot txt.

155
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.111
I could have named these anything but
I named them MD five dot txt.

156
00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:35.469
And shaw one dot txt So I know what they
are but you can name them whatever you'd

157
00:11:35.469 --> 00:11:40.930
like and I have the hash converting after
and bs is the sector size of 5, 12.

158
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:45.104
Now my output file I'm calling
it tests USB two dot image and

159
00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:49.862
then again it tells me the blocks
written and the blocks in and out and

160
00:11:49.862 --> 00:11:52.230
all those numbers should match.

161
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:57.760
And I go ahead and look in my test folder,
I can see that I have my test to image.

162
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.468
I still have my flash drive image but
I have my test to image and

163
00:12:01.468 --> 00:12:04.812
I have my MD five which gives
me the MD five hash value and

164
00:12:04.812 --> 00:12:08.340
the shaw one which gives
me the shaw one hash value.

165
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:13.092
The next command I'm going
to show you is the one that

166
00:12:13.092 --> 00:12:17.530
I really like the best and
that is the D C three D D.

167
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.470
And you'll see why in a second.

168
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.580
So I'm going to go ahead and
copy this command.

169
00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.590
I'm going to paste it here and
it will run as soon as I paste it.

170
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.440
So we have the Dc three DD.

171
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.137
The input file and
it's the same path devices STB Now

172
00:12:33.137 --> 00:12:38.581
the hash output STB image so
I'm hashing it with an output and

173
00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:41.810
I'm calling the output STB image.

174
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.658
My hash is going to equal an MD five and
sha one and

175
00:12:45.658 --> 00:12:50.300
I'm putting him in the log,
the log equals hash dot txt.

176
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.690
So we'll go ahead and
we'll run the command and

177
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.422
you can see it is we're running and

178
00:12:54.422 --> 00:12:58.580
you can see that it's running because you
see the bites as they're being copied.

179
00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.691
So it kind of has a progress bar
similar to what you can do with F D.

180
00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:03.630
K.
Imager.

181
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.650
Whereas the other two we ran them and

182
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.360
we just waited until my
command line came back.

183
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:14.280
It's finished and we can see that we get
the bytes copied and the bites hashed.

184
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.550
And those number of bytes should match.

185
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.460
We can see the sectors in.

186
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.630
It reports zero bad sectors.

187
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.671
And this is the input results for
the device.

188
00:13:23.671 --> 00:13:27.665
So it's hashing the device
similar to FTK imager and

189
00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:31.770
then it's hashing the output file,
our image file.

190
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.401
And it's giving us the hash values for
the image file and those hashtags match.

191
00:13:36.401 --> 00:13:40.670
And that's showing us that no data on
the drive was changed when we created our

192
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.887
image and that's what makes
a forensically sound image,

193
00:13:43.887 --> 00:13:47.530
that we can show that we made no
changes to the original evidence.

194
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:52.800
It also gives you a time when it
completed at a time when it started.

195
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.592
So you get more of a robust
output with D C three

196
00:13:58.592 --> 00:14:06.381
D D than we do with the other
commands like D D or even D C F L, D.

197
00:14:06.381 --> 00:14:10.123
D.
We can create the hash values but we don't

198
00:14:10.123 --> 00:14:15.881
get the hash of the evidence in the hash
of the image file so that we can see.

199
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:17.190
We've made no changes.

200
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:22.074
You could always hash your image
file using a hash some command,

201
00:14:22.074 --> 00:14:24.170
but that's an extra step.

202
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.540
And with this using this command,
we don't have to take that step.

203
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.127
Now.
What we can also do is I'm going to go

204
00:14:30.127 --> 00:14:34.859
ahead and close terminal for now is I
can take a look at my USB test drive and

205
00:14:34.859 --> 00:14:37.140
I can see what's on there.

206
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.860
What's kind of nice with Lennox.

207
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.940
I'm going to go ahead and
I am going to eject my test drive.

208
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:48.306
I can open up my test folder and
I can take my STB image and

209
00:14:48.306 --> 00:14:51.701
I can open it with image dismount.

210
00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:55.234
Now I mounted my USB drive,
the original evidence itself or

211
00:14:55.234 --> 00:14:58.767
my test drive in this case and
now I've mounted the image and

212
00:14:58.767 --> 00:15:03.076
I can bring the image up and I can see
that the files are the same as they were

213
00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:06.940
on the test drive and
I could go through that if I wanted to.

214
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:13.110
So I do have the ability in Lenox
to mount the image as a bribe.

215
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:17.210
And you also have the ability
to go ahead and amounted.

216
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:23.642
And that ends our demonstration
of the Lennox D D D C F L D D and

217
00:15:23.642 --> 00:15:27.640
D C three D D commands for imaging.

218
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.560
In our next course, we're going to talk
about hash values and file hashing
