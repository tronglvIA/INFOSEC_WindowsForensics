00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.090
Welcome back to the computer
forensics path course 11.

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.640
We're talking about creating
a forensic disk image.

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.838
And in module four we're going
to talk about creating and

4
00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:17.280
validating our forensic disk image so
far we've covered sterile media.

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.991
We've talked about how important it is
to write our evidence files to media

6
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:24.340
that is free of any other data.

7
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.291
We've also talked about validating
our tools in this module.

8
00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:35.060
We're going to talk about how we actually
create the forensic image itself and

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.861
validated.

10
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.072
Now copying versus imaging
a full forensic copy

11
00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:49.621
otherwise known as an image
will contain allocated files.

12
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:53.140
It's going to contain
files lack deleted files.

13
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.911
All are unallocated space,
unused space and an H P A And the D O C.

14
00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:01.450
If there is one H P A.

15
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.360
Stands for host protected area and D O C.

16
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.958
Is an area that is used
to resize the drive and

17
00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:14.240
they are done by
the manufacturer of the drive.

18
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.640
But you want to make sure that your
forensic tool is able to read that area.

19
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.061
All modern forensic software will
cover the H P A And the D O C.

20
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.512
Now if we just copy a file like in
the Windows Explorer re right click and

21
00:01:32.512 --> 00:01:38.540
copy of file, all we're getting is
the allocated file and the file slack.

22
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.107
You're not getting any of
the unallocated space, deleted files or

23
00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:47.440
unused space on that disk or
any of the operating system.

24
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.140
Yeah.

25
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.944
When you make a full forensic
image you are copying from

26
00:01:52.944 --> 00:01:57.852
Physical bytes zero all the way
through to the end of that

27
00:01:57.852 --> 00:02:02.570
drive everything forensic
copying versus cloning.

28
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.140
The difference between making
a forensic copy our cloning it dry.

29
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.556
When you clone a drive it is
a bit by the copy of the original

30
00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:15.540
drive onto a drive of the same size or
larger.

31
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.621
So you're physically copying that dear.

32
00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:19.210
You're cloning that drive.

33
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.751
You could put that drive in
your computer and boot it.

34
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.791
If the target drive is larger,
it should be filled with all zeros.

35
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:35.291
The remaining space that is not taken
up should be back filled with zeros.

36
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.251
And if you thoroughly wipe your media it
will automatically be filled with zeros.

37
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.717
And this is creating a clone
of the original drive,

38
00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:52.261
not creating a forensic copy,
forensic evidence files.

39
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.360
They also contain a bit by bit,
a copy of the original evidence.

40
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.640
Everything will still be there.

41
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.840
But these are container files and
they're actually files.

42
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.840
So they may contain some extra data
like a header or a check song.

43
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.851
For error checking.

44
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.717
This will not affect our hash value
because when we hash it is only going to

45
00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:19.861
hash the data, it's not hashing
the header and the check zones.

46
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.101
You can have compression with
these forensic image files And

47
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:31.240
you know, one is a compressed file.

48
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.020
So we could put that on media that is
smaller than the original evidence.

49
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.211
And you may want to use
that format to save space.

50
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.630
But remember these
are forensic evidence files.

51
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.130
There are container file,
it is really hard to alter them.

52
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.940
You would actually have to go into
a hex editor and physically alter them.

53
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.931
Whereas when you're doing the forensic
copy cloning it is very easy

54
00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:03.040
to damage the original evidence.

55
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.851
So you want to be very careful
types of evidence files?

56
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:10.910
Well we have the DD which
is actually the same.

57
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.141
It will be the same size.

58
00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:14.453
There's no compression in a DVD so

59
00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:19.011
it will be the same size as the original
evidence Like I said before.

60
00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:23.980
The EO one is compressed, so
is the A F, F and the smart.

61
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.861
And there are many more types
of forensic evidence files.

62
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.091
Remember our target drive,
we're going to use sterile media,

63
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:37.800
it must be at least the same size or
larger than the original evidence drive.

64
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.521
If we're using a non compressed image,

65
00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:46.840
your target dry,
you have to think about the format.

66
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.343
And this becomes important when
say your taking a forensic

67
00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:58.519
image of a mac computer and
you're going to examine that on a Windows

68
00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:04.135
computer You need a file system
that can cross platforms and

69
00:05:04.135 --> 00:05:10.561
that would be expat ex fat will work
in Mac or Windows or even Lennox.

70
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.338
So if you have a target
drive four minute X Fat,

71
00:05:15.338 --> 00:05:19.740
you could use it on any
of those file systems.

72
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.179
So when you have your target drives,

73
00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:26.450
make sure you have them formatted
in different file systems.

74
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.994
You probably want to Windows, you probably
want to expat, you may want to A PFS

75
00:05:31.994 --> 00:05:37.800
depending on what you routinely examining
and what your examination machine is.

76
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.640
If you're examining a Mac computer,
you want to use a Mac computer.

77
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.522
You don't want to try to examine a MAC on
a Windows machine because you may miss

78
00:05:49.522 --> 00:05:50.961
some important data.

79
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.316
When we're creating our
forensic evidence files,

80
00:05:57.316 --> 00:06:01.078
we're going to create
an image of a drive and

81
00:06:01.078 --> 00:06:05.740
this would be traditional
forensics dead box.

82
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.640
We would remove the evidence
drive from the computer.

83
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.740
We would use our target drive
that we've already prepared.

84
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.280
We would have already
validated our write blocker.

85
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.534
We validated our imaging software,
We're going to

86
00:06:21.534 --> 00:06:26.465
connect our hardware write
blocker to our evidence drive and

87
00:06:26.465 --> 00:06:31.040
we're going to connect
that to the computer.

88
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.240
This is showing you what a hardware
write blocker looks like.

89
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.556
And you can see here the evidence
drive is connected to it and

90
00:06:39.556 --> 00:06:44.476
you can see it's an intel solid state
drive and the wire that is red,

91
00:06:44.476 --> 00:06:48.740
black and
yellow that is the power connector.

92
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:55.140
The wire that is solid black going from
the right blocker to the evidence.

93
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.879
That is our say to this
is a state of Dr and

94
00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:02.300
you can see on the left hand side we
have a blue cord that is a U S B.

95
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.540
Cord and that needs to be
connected to our forensic station.

96
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.961
And then the black court
above that is the power cord.

97
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.671
You can see here I have my
target drive label target drive,

98
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:21.645
we have our write blocker and over to
the right we can see it is connected

99
00:07:21.645 --> 00:07:25.551
to our evidence and
that is connected to our computer.

100
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:32.340
And this is how the setup would look for
a hardware write blocker.

101
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.126
This one happens to be a tableau but

102
00:07:35.126 --> 00:07:42.140
there are many other brands out there
on the market, the imaging process.

103
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.071
Once we've got our write blocker connected
and we're ready to go, we're going to

104
00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:51.784
pre hash, we're going to take a hash
value with some type of imaging software,

105
00:07:51.784 --> 00:07:54.040
whichever you choose.

106
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.761
And we're going to pre hash
the original evidence.

107
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:03.440
Then we're going to create a forensic
image of the original evidence.

108
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.908
Once the image is completed, we're going
to validate the image, we're going

109
00:08:08.908 --> 00:08:14.209
to take a hash value of the image and the
hash value of the image file that we just

110
00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:19.861
created should match the hash value of
the original evidence that we took before.

111
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:26.011
Once we've done that, we're going to do
a post hash of the original evidence.

112
00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:30.930
We're going to hash that original evidence
drive one more time just to show we have

113
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.340
not made any changes to
the original evidence.

114
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.257
Once you've done that, you're
going to shut your write blocker off,

115
00:08:39.257 --> 00:08:44.440
disconnect your evidence drive and
you're going to put it away.

116
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.020
We're not touching
the original evidence again,

117
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.061
we're going to work off of our image file.

118
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.940
We're going to do a walkthrough of imaging
and the items we're going to need.

119
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.930
We're going to need R N T F S B H D And
F T K.

120
00:08:58.930 --> 00:08:59.651
Immature.

121
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.600
We're going to make a forensic image
of R N T F S B HD using F D K.

122
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.960
Immature in this walkthrough.

123
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:17.150
We're going to create a disk image
using R N T F S V H D And F T K Imager.

124
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.710
We're going to use images to create
a forensic image of the V H D.

125
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.852
Go to disk management and
attach your PHD again,

126
00:09:25.852 --> 00:09:30.703
if you don't remember how to
do that actions attached Bhd

127
00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:34.961
browse to where the virtual
hard drive is stored.

128
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.030
Select it, click open, click OK.

129
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.933
And the V H D will mount
once your phds mount and

130
00:09:43.933 --> 00:09:48.841
note the disk number because we're
going to be imaging the physical drive.

131
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:51.710
The entire desk mayan is disk 11.

132
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.550
Yours will probably be different.

133
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.240
Now we're going to launch F D k Imager.

134
00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:02.240
Once Imager opens, we're going to
go to file, Create a disk image.

135
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.490
It's going to be a physical drive and
we're going to click next.

136
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.950
Now we're going to use the drop
down arrow to select our drive.

137
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.230
Mine was Dr 11.

138
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.151
Select it.

139
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.883
Once you've done that,

140
00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:21.150
click finish first we select the type.

141
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:26.240
I'm going to pick Roddy D
because that is the quickest but

142
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.940
we could go with an E 01 A smart or
an AFF.

143
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.640
I'm going to click next.

144
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.822
Then you give it your case number and
evidence, item number, you describe it,

145
00:10:38.822 --> 00:10:45.040
you put your name in as the examiner and
you can add any notes if you'd like.

146
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.230
Then hit next.

147
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.870
Now it's asking for
the image destination folder.

148
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.777
So I'm going to browse
out to my desktop and

149
00:10:51.777 --> 00:10:57.140
I'm going to make a new folder and
I'm going to call it N T F S V HD image.

150
00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:02.205
I'm going to go ahead and
select that folder, click OK, now give it

151
00:11:02.205 --> 00:11:08.400
a file name but don't put a file extension
and I'm going to call it class image.

152
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.190
You can call it whatever you want.

153
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.970
You normally name it something like
the case number for fragment size.

154
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:21.040
I'm going to put none and compression
since I'm doing a raw DD there is none.

155
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.151
If I was doing any 01 or another type of
image there would be some compression.

156
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.241
I'm going to click finish.

157
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.540
I'm going to click verify
image after they are created.

158
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.712
I'm not going to check any of
these other boxes, but you could

159
00:11:36.712 --> 00:11:40.870
create a directory listing of all the
files in the image after they're created.

160
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.100
Which may be helpful in some cases.

161
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:48.452
We can talk about that throughout this
path, but for now I'm going to hit

162
00:11:48.452 --> 00:11:54.334
start and you can see that it's processing
very quickly because it's small and

163
00:11:54.334 --> 00:11:58.410
now it is verifying the image
now an image or finishes.

164
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:03.061
You're going to have information on
the screen and let's take a look at that.

165
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.922
We have our sector count,
we have the name of the image,

166
00:12:08.922 --> 00:12:12.640
We have the MD five and Sha 1 # values.

167
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:20.440
Now what FBK immature is doing is it is
hashing the source and passing the image.

168
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.091
It's happening.

169
00:12:21.091 --> 00:12:24.437
My source,
passing the image of created and

170
00:12:24.437 --> 00:12:29.250
it's telling me that they match and
no bad sectors were found.

171
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.841
Now you can go ahead and close this
because Imager does keep a record of this.

172
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:38.063
If you click on image summary,
we could see the record and

173
00:12:38.063 --> 00:12:40.570
it has the case information
that I added in.

174
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.929
It tells you the name of the software
that created it in the version and

175
00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:49.990
it gives you some drive geometry bytes,
per sector and the total sector count.

176
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.290
And it shows you the MD five and
sha one check sums.

177
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.671
It also tells you the time you
started your acquisition and

178
00:12:56.671 --> 00:12:59.100
the time you finished your acquisition.

179
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.251
And it also tells you the time
the verification started.

180
00:13:02.251 --> 00:13:05.512
That is the MD five and
sha one hashes being created and

181
00:13:05.512 --> 00:13:09.862
when the verification finished and
this is all saved out to a text file so

182
00:13:09.862 --> 00:13:11.850
you can go ahead and close that.

183
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.230
Now let's go ahead and look at our image.

184
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.034
I say that out on my system in a folder
called N T F S underscore V H D

185
00:13:19.034 --> 00:13:21.848
underscore image and we look there,

186
00:13:21.848 --> 00:13:26.140
we can see we have the one file and
we have the text file.

187
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.544
If you look at the text file,
it opens up in note pad and

188
00:13:29.544 --> 00:13:32.740
it has all that information
that we talked about.

189
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.880
It shows the case number, the item number
and all the information that I put in.

190
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.140
It tells you the sources physical.

191
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.327
And again we see the hash values and all
the information we looked at in the image

192
00:13:43.327 --> 00:13:46.840
summer that was on the screen is
safe to this nice text file for us.

193
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.088
So we have it including
when we started and

194
00:13:49.088 --> 00:13:52.710
when we finished with both
the acquisition and the verification.

195
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.720
So this is going to be important
information that you want documented and

196
00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.020
FDK does provide that documentation for
you when you're creating an image.

197
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.485
If you're just doing a hash value or
verifying an image,

198
00:14:04.485 --> 00:14:09.539
it does not save the file and that's when
we need to save that information ourselves

199
00:14:09.539 --> 00:14:14.120
either through a screenshot or snip or
wherever you want to document that.

200
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.310
Now I'm going to take
a look at my image so

201
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.720
I'm going to go to file at evidence item.

202
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.610
It is a image file.

203
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.930
I'm going to browse store,

204
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.360
I saved it which was out of
my desktop in that folder.

205
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.012
I'm going to select the 0.1 file and
click open and

206
00:14:28.012 --> 00:14:33.340
then I'm going to click finish and
we can see all our partitions laid out.

207
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.960
We can see our file system is fat 32.

208
00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.210
We have another one that's NTFS and we
could see our extended partition also and

209
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.640
the extended logical partitions within it.

210
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.934
You can drill down further and
we see some of the documents we've seen

211
00:14:46.934 --> 00:14:52.140
throughout this path and you can scroll
through and look at the information.

212
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.627
We see all the files and

213
00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:57.937
folders have been working with
throughout the path on RN T F S V H D.

214
00:14:57.937 --> 00:15:02.501
So we've successfully created our first
forensic image in the next module.

215
00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:08.577
We're going to talk about using
the Lennox D D D D D C F L D D and

216
00:15:08.577 --> 00:15:15.651
D C three D D commands to create
a forensic image end of walk through.
