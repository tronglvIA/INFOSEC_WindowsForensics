00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.185
Welcome back to the
Windows Forensic Path.

2
00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:07.725
In Course 11, we're talking about

3
00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:11.510
creating a forensic disk image.

4
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.040
In this module, Module 2,

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.789
we're going to talk about
validating our forensic tools.

6
00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.280
Validation is important because

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.650
we want to ensure the accuracy

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.560
of our findings and conclusions.

9
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.235
If we haven't validated
the tools we're using,

10
00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:33.570
how can we say with

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.180
certainty that they're
working properly?

12
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.369
We want to be aware of
any software issues,

13
00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:43.220
so we need to test and
validate to make sure that

14
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.140
your tools are working and you do

15
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.915
not have any software issues.

16
00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:52.850
We want to avoid our findings
being called into question.

17
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.830
If we haven't tested
and validated,

18
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.430
it leaves a big hole for somebody

19
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.715
to attack us on the
validity of our findings.

20
00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:06.945
What should be validated?

21
00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:08.480
Well, definitely you want to

22
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.564
validate your hardware
write blockers,

23
00:01:10.564 --> 00:01:12.785
and you want to make
sure they're working.

24
00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:16.019
You want to validate your
software write blockers,

25
00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:18.330
I would do this at each use.

26
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.995
You want to make sure you
validate your imaging software,

27
00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:24.380
the software we're going
to use to make the image

28
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.780
just to ensure that it
is working correctly,

29
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.500
and you want to also validate
your examination software,

30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.120
the software you're going to use

31
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.390
to conduct your examination.

32
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.180
When we're validating our
hardware write blockers,

33
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.490
you want to use a
designated drive.

34
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.610
You want to have a
designated test drive in

35
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.050
your lab that you

36
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.080
use to validate your
hardware write blockers.

37
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.235
You never validate on
the original evidence.

38
00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:55.040
You want to know
the hash value of

39
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.515
the drive that you are using,

40
00:01:57.515 --> 00:01:59.480
the designated
drive you're using.

41
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.955
It is good to use a small drive

42
00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:05.735
because it makes it faster
to do the validation.

43
00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:09.215
Validate at least monthly or

44
00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:14.765
whatever your operation requires.

45
00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:17.810
Keep the firmware updated.

46
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.850
Hardware write blockers
have internal firmware,

47
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.340
and you want to make sure that

48
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.470
your firmware is up-to-date.

49
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.495
You never want to be embarrassed

50
00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:28.790
finding out that you're
write blocker failed

51
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.055
because you as the investigator

52
00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:34.605
failed to update your firmware.

53
00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:38.435
The validation process for
a hardware write blocker

54
00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:39.740
is you'll connect your

55
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.445
designated test drive
to the write blocker,

56
00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:46.445
you will conduct a hash
value of the test drive.

57
00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:49.250
Once you've conducted
the hash value,

58
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.000
you'll attempt to
write to the drive.

59
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.990
Then you will rehash

60
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.050
the test drive and the
hash value should match.

61
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.345
Now, while you're going
through this process,

62
00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.975
you want to be documenting.

63
00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:05.355
You want to be writing
your steps down,

64
00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:09.230
you want to take screenshots
of your write attempts to

65
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.420
show that you have
attempted to write to

66
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.540
the drive and that
you were not able to,

67
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.185
and you want to record
your beginning hash value,

68
00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:21.050
the one you do before you
attempt to write to the drive,

69
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.940
and the hash value you do

70
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.330
after you've attempted
to write to the drive.

71
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.900
You want to record all this,

72
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.550
you want to keep it in
a file somewhere in

73
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.990
your lab, and like I said,

74
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.975
you want to do it
at least monthly

75
00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:35.920
or whatever your agency requires.

76
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.405
Validating your software
write blockers.

77
00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:42.740
Now, software write
blockers are used

78
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.255
mainly on removable media
at this point in time.

79
00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:47.840
Or you're going to use them on

80
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.360
a hard drive that
cannot be removed,

81
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.225
like when we talked
about booting into

82
00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:58.710
a Linux distro or a
Windows FE distro.

83
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.450
You're going to use these when

84
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.790
the hardware option
is not available.

85
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.580
If you have a hardware
options available,

86
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.450
always use it over
the software option,

87
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.290
and make sure that you keep

88
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.390
your software write
blockers updated.

89
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.520
Software write blockers also
use a designated drive.

90
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.460
Again, have a designated
USB device because you're

91
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.170
mainly going to use
these things on

92
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.540
removable media at
this point in time,

93
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.295
know the hash value
of that drive,

94
00:04:32.295 --> 00:04:34.490
use a small drive,

95
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.220
and validate it before each use.

96
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.620
The process would
be the same as it

97
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.210
was with your hardware
write blocker.

98
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.565
You would initiate the
software write blocker

99
00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:49.985
and make sure it's turned on,

100
00:04:49.985 --> 00:04:52.324
plug in the USB device,

101
00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:54.665
hash the USB device,

102
00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:56.150
attempt to write to it,

103
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.950
and then rehash the device and

104
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.170
make sure those
hash values match.

105
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.540
It doesn't take very long to do,

106
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.390
and I highly recommend
doing it before each use.

107
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.200
When you do it, you're going
to do it on your test drive,

108
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.615
never ever validate
on original evidence.

109
00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:17.710
We're going to activate the
software write blocker,

110
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.430
we're going to connect
the test drive

111
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.185
to our examination computer.

112
00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:23.000
We're going to hash
the test drive,

113
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.270
we're going to attempt to
write to the test drive,

114
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.295
and rehash the test drive.

115
00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:31.045
That is the validation process.

116
00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:34.205
Our hash values should
be the same, and again,

117
00:05:34.205 --> 00:05:36.830
make sure you document
the results and

118
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.420
the actions that
you took when you

119
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.640
attempted to write
throughout this process.

120
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.110
You should also keep these
validations somewhere in

121
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.720
your lab so that you can

122
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.365
show documentation if it's
ever called into question.

123
00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:54.460
Now, your imaging software.

124
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.570
One thing you want
to make sure about

125
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.120
your imaging software is
you want to make sure it

126
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.700
is imaging the
entire physical disk

127
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.515
if you're imaging
a physical drive.

128
00:06:03.515 --> 00:06:06.960
Make sure you're getting
the entire drive.

129
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.785
When you validate again,

130
00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:15.640
use a test drive with a known
size and known hash values.

131
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.105
The hashes should match;

132
00:06:19.105 --> 00:06:20.810
the hash of the test drive,

133
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.360
should match the
hash of the image,

134
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.505
and when you rehash
the test drive,

135
00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:28.540
that hash value
should also match.

136
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.100
Use a small drive because

137
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.500
it makes the process
much quicker.

138
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.450
Keep your software updated,
your imaging software.

139
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.615
You should not be using
outdated versions.

140
00:06:41.615 --> 00:06:45.190
Validate as required
by your agency policy.

141
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.270
If you do not have
a policy, again,

142
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.835
I would recommend doing
it in disk once a month.

143
00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:54.445
Again, you need to document
the results of a validation.

144
00:06:54.445 --> 00:06:57.585
Our examination software.

145
00:06:57.585 --> 00:07:00.390
Read through these notes on

146
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.110
your evaluation software so

147
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.900
you know if there
are any known bugs.

148
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.735
Be aware of these known issues.

149
00:07:09.735 --> 00:07:13.025
Always update your
examination software

150
00:07:13.025 --> 00:07:16.110
to the latest stable version.

151
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.605
The process is similar.

152
00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:22.150
We're going to use a
designated validation drive.

153
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.170
Your lab should have a
drive that they use to

154
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.720
validate the software you're

155
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.220
examining your evidence with.

156
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.705
The drive should
have known results.

157
00:07:34.705 --> 00:07:36.685
It should have known hash values,

158
00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:40.270
and it also should have
known files on it.

159
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.100
You want to cover

160
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.860
all the major functions
of your software.

161
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.805
Whatever examination
software you're using,

162
00:07:48.805 --> 00:07:51.020
when you do your validation,

163
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.635
that should include all
the major functions

164
00:07:53.635 --> 00:07:55.450
of that particular
piece of software.

165
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.760
If you're looking for
a lot of image files,

166
00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.720
for example, part of

167
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.265
your validation should be
recovering image files.

168
00:08:03.265 --> 00:08:07.130
Cover the common areas
of your examinations.

169
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.235
Follow your agency policy,

170
00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:14.045
and document the results
of your validation.

171
00:08:14.045 --> 00:08:17.300
If you're somewhere that
does not have a policy,

172
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.535
I would do a validation with

173
00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:23.460
each full-number upgrade
of the software.

174
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:30.575
If you go from version
4.1 to version 5.1,

175
00:08:30.575 --> 00:08:34.740
when that 4 becomes a 5 is
when you need to validate.

176
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.330
What validation does for
us is it allows us to be

177
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.680
confident in the accuracy of

178
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.935
our findings and conclusions.

179
00:08:41.935 --> 00:08:45.425
Because if we didn't test
our examination software,

180
00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:48.380
how can we be confident with
the findings that we're

181
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.310
seeing when our dates and
times with the files recovery,

182
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.500
the locations that software

183
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.510
is telling us these
files came from?

184
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.010
You definitely need to

185
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.515
validate your
examination software.

186
00:09:00.515 --> 00:09:03.680
We also want to adhere to
scientific principle We talked

187
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.420
about scientific principles at

188
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.325
the beginning of this path.

189
00:09:07.325 --> 00:09:09.860
This also helps us head off

190
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.425
our findings being
called into question.

191
00:09:12.425 --> 00:09:14.295
In our next module,

192
00:09:14.295 --> 00:09:16.200
we're going to take
a close look at

193
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:22.330
our write blockers and talk
about how they function.
