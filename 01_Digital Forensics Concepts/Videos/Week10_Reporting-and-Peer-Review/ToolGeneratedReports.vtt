1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
Welcome back to Digital
Forensic Concepts.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.205
In this course, we're talking

3
00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.320
about report writing
and peer review.

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.820
In Module 2, we're going to
cover tool-generated reports,

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.865
reports generated by
our forensic software.

6
00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:19.080
Each forensic tool reports
slightly different.

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.990
There's going to be
slightly different options,

8
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.610
slightly different ways in

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.860
which it displays our findings.

10
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.959
Most of these tool-generated
reports are very technical,

11
00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:32.565
so know your audience

12
00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.800
if you're going to use
one of these reports.

13
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.995
Most of these reports
do contain a lot

14
00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:41.345
of unneeded and
unwanted information,

15
00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:43.370
as we'll see when we
do our walk through.

16
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.745
I want to talk about
two software suites

17
00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:49.045
that do reporting.

18
00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:52.205
Almost any of your software
suites we'll do reporting.

19
00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:56.975
That includes FTK, EnCase, Axiom.

20
00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:59.390
But the two we're going
to look at are X-Ways,

21
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.725
which is a commercial suite,

22
00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:03.225
it does cost money,

23
00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:06.620
and Autopsy, which is a
free and open source tool.

24
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.710
When we take a look at the
Report Wizard in X-Ways,

25
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.405
as we see here up on our screen,

26
00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:15.845
we have the options
to put in a logo.

27
00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:18.290
We can put in a report header.

28
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.870
We can even put in a preface like

29
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.680
a paragraph,
prefacing our report.

30
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.125
We can include our search hits.

31
00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:30.560
We can choose selected
evidence objects

32
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.630
that we want to report from.

33
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.674
We could convert our
report to a PDF.

34
00:01:35.674 --> 00:01:39.955
Now up top here it says
Include report tables.

35
00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:42.565
Now X-Ways calls report

36
00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:45.710
tables bookmarks,
they're the same thing.

37
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.824
Most tools call these bookmarks,

38
00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:50.530
but in X-ways they call
them report tables.

39
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.000
You can see we have some
different ones here,

40
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.500
we have Jump lists, Link files,

41
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.810
Event logs, Prefetch files.

42
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.215
You can choose to include all
of these or some of them.

43
00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.380
You can sort them by
the evidence ID number,

44
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.350
which is an eternal number
given by the software.

45
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.180
We can have them in the order

46
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.115
they are currently in the case.

47
00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:12.260
You can decide how many lines you

48
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.145
want per row in your output file.

49
00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:18.800
We can also copy a link
to each one of these.

50
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.385
This is an HTML type report
we're generating here.

51
00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:24.965
We would have a link to
each of these items,

52
00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:28.955
which we could click on and
see the actual evidence item.

53
00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:30.860
You can create thumbnails.

54
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.395
You could have them
positioned above

55
00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:38.100
the row or below the row
that displays your artifact.

56
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.280
Further down here, at the bottom,

57
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.825
on the right-hand side,

58
00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:43.970
we see a whole bunch of Name,

59
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.030
Type, Description, Report,
Table path, Full path.

60
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.040
You can choose to include any of

61
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.410
these type of
metadata information.

62
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.970
This also includes your dates
and times you can see here.

63
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.970
You can't see them in this
particular photograph,

64
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.405
but they are listed as
one of the options.

65
00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:04.430
You have a whole bunch
of ways that you can

66
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.770
customize your report here
with the X-Ways forensic tool.

67
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.940
Now, Autopsy, the first

68
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.950
screen you're going to come
to in your Report Wizard,

69
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.375
you're going to choose what type

70
00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:16.625
of output you're
doing, your reporting.

71
00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:18.560
You can do it HTML,

72
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.294
Excel, a regular text file,

73
00:03:21.294 --> 00:03:24.150
you can even do a
Google Earth KML

74
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.510
if that's the type
of case you have.

75
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.435
You can do a portable case

76
00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:30.890
to an Autopsy and
allows you to do

77
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.870
a portable case that
you could turn over to

78
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.375
another examiner,
possible peer review.

79
00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:37.700
You can create a header,

80
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.540
in this type I've
written case report,

81
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.035
and a footer, now I
just put end of report.

82
00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:45.950
But you can type anything
you want in these boxes.

83
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.155
Now as you go through
the Report Wizard,

84
00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:51.455
you're going to have the
example to include All Results,

85
00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:56.805
All Tagged Results or
Specific Tag Results.

86
00:03:56.805 --> 00:04:00.425
You can see down here in the
white box on the screen,

87
00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:02.930
I can choose to
include my bookmarks,

88
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.115
my notable items or my Prefetch.

89
00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:09.530
There are different types of
bookmarks I've created here.

90
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.660
If I chose All Results,

91
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.780
I'd be presented with a
Window where I'd be able

92
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.155
to include or exclude
certain types of results.

93
00:04:18.155 --> 00:04:19.490
I can have Web Bookmarks,

94
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.260
Web Cache, Web
Cookies, downloads,

95
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.210
but I could also
deselect these if they

96
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.880
weren't relevant to my case.

97
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.550
Now we're going to do a demo
with Autopsy and X-Ways.

98
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.570
I'm going to take a look at

99
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.420
the reports that they
generate and how they

100
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.700
look and the types of information
that they will contain.

101
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.810
Welcome to our tool-generated
report demonstration.

102
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.090
We're going to start with X-Ways,

103
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.405
which is a paid commercial tool.

104
00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:51.375
I have a case created
and opened here.

105
00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:55.905
I'm going to go to
File, Create Report.

106
00:04:55.905 --> 00:05:00.934
We see that report generator,

107
00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:02.300
like we saw a screenshot

108
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.370
of in our PowerPoint
presentation.

109
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.920
I do have an option
to put in a logo.

110
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.115
This is the optional
report header,

111
00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:15.350
and it's just simply
case report X-Ways.

112
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.825
I could change that, and I have.

113
00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:18.860
I can put it on the left,

114
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.060
the center or the right.

115
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.435
I can output an activity log.

116
00:05:26.435 --> 00:05:30.275
I can do it in selected
evidence items,

117
00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:33.260
which I could put it
in a single partition

118
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.659
or something outside my
partition boundaries.

119
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.060
I'm not going to do that.

120
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.615
Up here we see all
the report tables.

121
00:05:45.615 --> 00:05:49.455
Report tables are what
X-Ways calls bookmarks.

122
00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:52.575
Most tools call them
bookmarks or tags.

123
00:05:52.575 --> 00:05:55.515
In X-Ways they call
them report tables.

124
00:05:55.515 --> 00:05:58.050
I have the Firefox
browser, Jump list,

125
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.290
Link files, Event logs,
Prefetch, Chrome.

126
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.590
That seems to be all I have here.

127
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.190
I can include these
simply by highlighting,

128
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.640
holding down my control key.

129
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.700
I could pick as many as I want.

130
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.860
I'm just going to go
ahead and pick them all.

131
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.925
I also have the options of
choosing how the output looks.

132
00:06:24.925 --> 00:06:27.580
I can do three lines per file,

133
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.679
I can do page breaks,

134
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.050
list each evidence
file only once,

135
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.370
and I can make copies of

136
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.640
the files so they can be
included in the report.

137
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.320
This is an HTML output.

138
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.450
I do have the option
of converting

139
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.790
it to a PDF output if I want to.

140
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.390
I can create thumbnails
for each of the files.

141
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.180
Now, what metadata
information do I want?

142
00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.130
Well, I definitely
want name, type,

143
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:06.355
report table, path, extension,

144
00:07:06.355 --> 00:07:09.850
and you can see this list
is fairly extensive.

145
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.130
We have it created,

146
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:19.375
modified, record
change, and accessed.

147
00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:22.160
I could see if it's deleted.

148
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.655
I can include the hash values.

149
00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:29.110
There's all types of information,

150
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.030
I can pick or choose down here.

151
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.010
I can generate a file signature.

152
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.290
There's all different
types of things I can do.

153
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.910
We're just going
to keep it fairly

154
00:07:54.910 --> 00:08:00.170
simple so it doesn't look
overwhelming when it comes out.

155
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.505
But if some of these

156
00:08:03.505 --> 00:08:05.920
specific characteristics
were important to you,

157
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.690
you'd want to make sure
you included them.

158
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.710
I also have the
option of outputting

159
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.605
my metadata like it
shows in details mode.

160
00:08:17.605 --> 00:08:18.850
I'm not going to do
that because that

161
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.575
would take up a lot of space.

162
00:08:20.575 --> 00:08:24.535
When I'm done, I simply
can click "Okay".

163
00:08:24.535 --> 00:08:28.250
Now I have to choose
where I want to save it.

164
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.930
I'm just going to leave
it on the default

165
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.300
here and click "Save".

166
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:39.080
Now, it's going to say
it's successfully saved,

167
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.855
and now I can click "Okay",

168
00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:46.580
and I can view the report.

169
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.420
This is what the
report looks like.

170
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.630
The first part is just giving me

171
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.810
some geometry of the drive,

172
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.659
the total capacity,
bytes per sector,

173
00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:08.320
the sector count, what
the partition style is,

174
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.180
master boot record,
file-system and DFS.

175
00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.310
It gives that for
all the partitions.

176
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:22.585
It gives you more informations
about each partition.

177
00:09:22.585 --> 00:09:25.794
Bytes per sector,
bytes per cluster,

178
00:09:25.794 --> 00:09:31.465
location of free clusters,
total free clusters.

179
00:09:31.465 --> 00:09:35.710
Just drives geometry
information for the partitions.

180
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.064
Now, we come to our items.

181
00:09:38.064 --> 00:09:42.475
We chose our Firefox bookmarks
and just list them out.

182
00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:45.310
The name of the file,

183
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:51.490
the type of the file,
cookies.sqllite file type.

184
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.270
The report table I have an n
is called Firefox browsers,

185
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.040
that's name of the bookmark.

186
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.540
It gives you the path.

187
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.090
It is existing, which
means it's not deleted.

188
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:08.690
Then my created modified record
chains and access times.

189
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.640
It just lists all
those files out.

190
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.130
Jump lists, give me the name of

191
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.759
the jump list and the
same type of information.

192
00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:22.195
Whatever type of information
you choose to put in here,

193
00:10:22.195 --> 00:10:25.760
make sure you can explain
it and you understand it.

194
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:30.130
If you don't, don't
put it in the report.

195
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.020
This is nothing more
embarrassing than

196
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.805
somebody asking about
something that's

197
00:10:33.805 --> 00:10:37.975
in your report and you
cannot explain it.

198
00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:40.870
That would make you look bad.

199
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.330
This is what a report
would look like.

200
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.310
It's not really pretty,

201
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.100
I don't really think
it's that user-friendly,

202
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.830
but that is what the x-rays

203
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.660
tool generator report
does look like.

204
00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.350
Now, let's take a
look at autopsy.

205
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.025
I've created a case in autopsy,

206
00:11:06.025 --> 00:11:09.755
and we're going to go ahead
and generate a report.

207
00:11:09.755 --> 00:11:16.180
I'm going to go to
tools, generate report.

208
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.480
With that autopsy,
we have a choice of

209
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.745
what type of report
we want to generate.

210
00:11:21.745 --> 00:11:23.410
Do we want to generate an XML,

211
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.330
an HTML, a plain text?

212
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.620
A TSK body file,

213
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.880
a Google Earth KML,

214
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.140
if you're doing
something that maps,

215
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:37.190
you might want to do that KML
or even the portable case.

216
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.210
I can put a header in here,

217
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:46.240
and I'm just going to put
a header case for class.

218
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:54.110
In the footer, I'm just going
to put end. We're an end.

219
00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.290
We're going to next
through the Report Wizard.

220
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.955
Now, it's asking me which
source I'm reporting on.

221
00:12:03.955 --> 00:12:05.770
I only have one
evidence item in here,

222
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.950
which is the, I have a VMDK.

223
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.125
If I hadn't more than one,

224
00:12:11.125 --> 00:12:14.150
I could choose which one or both.

225
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.820
We have that all results.

226
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.635
I could go all tagged results
or specific tagged results.

227
00:12:23.635 --> 00:12:26.560
Here's where I can pick
and choose which items I

228
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.320
want to include or not
include in the report.

229
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.800
I'm going to go to all results.

230
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.755
Then I can click down here.

231
00:12:37.755 --> 00:12:40.695
If I want to choose result types,

232
00:12:40.695 --> 00:12:43.050
I can choose to include all of

233
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.665
these or to take
some of them out.

234
00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:48.690
But I'm just going to
leave it the way it

235
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.735
is and we're going
to click "Finish".

236
00:12:51.735 --> 00:12:55.380
It's going to take a minute
to generate this report.

237
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.830
It's showing you the
file path to the report.

238
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.600
You might want to make note
of that so you know where to

239
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.820
find the report once
it's generated.

240
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.610
It's finished and we
can see our report.

241
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.870
Now we do have over here on

242
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.065
the left-hand side
a navigation pane,

243
00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:20.810
you can click on "Case Summary"
and that's what we're at,

244
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.310
the beginning of the report.

245
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.935
It's telling us the version
of autopsy that we're using,

246
00:13:26.935 --> 00:13:36.150
just 4.17.0 and it's giving
us our software information.

247
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.310
These are all the modules
that are installed in

248
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.530
this version of autopsy
that I have installed.

249
00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.310
It also gives you a history of

250
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.365
what options I ran

251
00:13:49.365 --> 00:13:52.690
and whether I let them
finish or I canceled them.

252
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.650
You have complete
documentation of

253
00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.780
the processes you ran on

254
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:06.510
your data source in

255
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.510
your case summary
which comes in handy.

256
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.845
Take a look at the accounts.

257
00:14:13.845 --> 00:14:16.470
These are the accounts that
are found on the system.

258
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.270
Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge,

259
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.880
which is the app name,
and then the URL,

260
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.919
when they were created,

261
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.845
the domain, the username,

262
00:14:34.845 --> 00:14:39.390
and where the source file
is inside the image itself,

263
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.540
how you would navigate
to it to look at

264
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:48.020
the file and you

265
00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.290
can scroll through when you
can see account emails.

266
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.300
It found all these
different email addresses,

267
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.470
email messages.

268
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.150
To detect some encryption,

269
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.980
suspected files
that are encrypted.

270
00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.315
These files may or may not be

271
00:15:09.315 --> 00:15:11.190
suspected encryption
and it's measuring

272
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.140
entropy and we'll talk about

273
00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:17.050
that in another
path, what that is.

274
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.720
It does show us
extension mismatch

275
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.900
and this is where the
file extension does

276
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.405
not match the actual file type

277
00:15:27.405 --> 00:15:29.280
because it's very easy to change

278
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.095
a file extension and a filename.

279
00:15:31.095 --> 00:15:32.970
If I had a PDF,

280
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.700
I could change it to a.gpg

281
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.790
file just simply by renaming it.

282
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.910
That would prevent the
operating system from accessing

283
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.160
the file but I would
still know it was there.

284
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.360
That is a simple way
of trying to hide

285
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.315
data but fairly easily
overcome as you see,

286
00:15:51.315 --> 00:15:54.090
it detects every mismatch
and then there's

287
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:59.295
241 extension mismatches
in this image file.

288
00:15:59.295 --> 00:16:03.045
Hash hits: This was
a notable hash,

289
00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:05.460
this is a packers and this is

290
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:13.125
a packing type program and you
could scroll through here.

291
00:16:13.125 --> 00:16:16.755
It has interesting
files, keyword hits.

292
00:16:16.755 --> 00:16:20.469
When we did our
keyword searching,

293
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.520
when we looked at grep
and keyword searches

294
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.110
in our last course,

295
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.810
then we can see all
our keyword hits.

296
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:39.400
Recent documents, tagged files.

297
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.215
That link is not working.

298
00:16:46.215 --> 00:16:49.080
It's showing us
all our tag files.

299
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.180
I didn't tag any images.

300
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.795
I tagged one result,

301
00:16:55.795 --> 00:16:58.260
it was a web history.

302
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.570
You can just get the idea.

303
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.090
You can scroll through
here and look at each of

304
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:13.900
these items inside the
report and see them.

305
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.780
I do like the way and down at

306
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.460
the bottom there's a
scroll bar and scroll

307
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:25.480
across because it's not
going to fit on one screen.

308
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:33.100
Then we have our dates and times.

309
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.910
We have a program in our domain.

310
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.020
Let's look at tag
files from in here.

311
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.100
These are files, these are PDFs.

312
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.430
These a couple of them are SQL

313
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.960
writes and we do have
a link file in here,

314
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.385
but we'll scroll across.

315
00:17:56.385 --> 00:17:59.520
You can see you have your
created access modified times,

316
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.245
we have the username,

317
00:18:01.245 --> 00:18:05.579
and we have our hash value
and the file size in bytes.

318
00:18:05.579 --> 00:18:07.800
Now this particular program

319
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.825
doesn't let me pick and choose

320
00:18:09.825 --> 00:18:12.240
what information I want but

321
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.910
it does put it out
in a very nice,

322
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.560
easy navigate through format.

323
00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.395
That is a look at

324
00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:28.845
tool-generated reports just
for a couple of tools.

325
00:18:28.845 --> 00:18:30.420
Like I said, all of

326
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.840
your full forensic suites
will generate a report.

327
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.990
End of demonstration.
