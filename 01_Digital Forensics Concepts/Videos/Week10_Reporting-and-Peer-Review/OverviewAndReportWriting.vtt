00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.740
Hello, and welcome back to
the digital forensic concept paths.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.622
In this course, course 11, we're going to
talk about reporting, and peer review.

3
00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:12.230
An overview of this course,

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.851
we're going to talk about report
writing the parts of the report.

5
00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:17.596
How we write the report, and

6
00:00:17.596 --> 00:00:21.980
to consider things we need to consider
when we're writing the report.

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.469
We're going to take a look at some tool
generated reports, and see the pros, and

8
00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:27.740
cons to those.

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.404
And we're also going to talk about
peer review, what it is, and

10
00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:33.240
why it's important.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.840
And in module one,
we're going to talk about report writing.

12
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.572
Well, report writing
starts with preparation.

13
00:00:41.572 --> 00:00:45.211
We have to have good note taking,
to have a good report.

14
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.475
Because you're not going to
remember everything you did.

15
00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:49.299
And what time you did it.

16
00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.743
And what were the circumstances.

17
00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:51.670
And who was there.

18
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.250
So you need to take good notes as
you go through your process of your

19
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.520
investigation.

20
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.430
So take the notes as you take the actions.

21
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.480
Don't wait, and
try to make the notes up later.

22
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.940
Take the notes as you're doing it.

23
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.240
We want to make sure we document all
our observations, things that we see.

24
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.425
Maybe we saw a destructive
program running on the screen,

25
00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:16.675
and we decided to pull the plug
from the back of the machine.

26
00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:20.504
We would want to make sure that we
documented that screen, took a photograph.

27
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.640
You want to document the actions we take.

28
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.800
What did we do in response to seeing that?

29
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.250
Well, we pulled the plug,
we want to document that.

30
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.470
You want to document what time that
you did that at the date, and time.

31
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.651
And that brings us to our next one.

32
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:36.640
We want to document the times
our actions were taken.

33
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.897
That's very important.

34
00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:41.056
And the reasons why we took
the actions that we did.

35
00:01:41.056 --> 00:01:47.110
The results of our examination need to
be reproducible by another examiner.

36
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.740
That's what makes them
scientifically sound.

37
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.630
A well-written report, you want to
think about your target audience.

38
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.240
Is it another examiner?

39
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.600
Is it a group of lay people?

40
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.084
Is it your boss?

41
00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:01.435
Is it an attorney's office?

42
00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:04.777
Who's going to be the audience for
your report?

43
00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:08.340
You want to make your report very clear,
and unambiguous.

44
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.645
You don't want to leave things hanging.

45
00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:12.470
You want to make sure
you explain everything.

46
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.040
Make sure it's a detail, but concise.

47
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.187
Nobody wants to read
a really wordy report, and

48
00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:21.590
people usually won't read
a really wordy report.

49
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.131
So make them detailed, bucket size.

50
00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:27.238
Make sure they're fact-based,
and unbiased.

51
00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:33.415
You can't bring preconceptions of personal
biases into your reporting, and findings.

52
00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:37.673
And you must include any
exculpatory evidence.

53
00:02:37.673 --> 00:02:39.219
Our exculpatory findings, and

54
00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.006
that would be findings that tended to
go against what you're trying to prove.

55
00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:47.724
Prove the person's innocence, or
prove that the act did not happen.

56
00:02:47.724 --> 00:02:50.123
Now, parts of the reports,
we have our narrative.

57
00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:53.860
And then in our narrative we're
going to talk about what we did find.

58
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.436
We're going to have exhibits,
and these can be things like,

59
00:02:57.436 --> 00:03:01.390
artifacts within the file system
that supports our hypothesis.

60
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.226
Maybe your hypothesis is that an employee
copied some documents to a USB drive.

61
00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:11.341
What you want to have some USB
connections with dates, and

62
00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:14.262
times that the devices were connected.

63
00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:19.400
Serial numbers, volume names, and maybe
you think a certain document was copied.

64
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.766
You might want to try to look for
link files,

65
00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:26.040
to find a link file to that volume
containing a certain document name.

66
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.624
So those are exhibits.

67
00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:31.861
The processes you used,
what forensic software did you use?

68
00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:33.210
What was your process?

69
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.390
How did you go about coming
to these conclusions?

70
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.070
Did you examine the link
files with autopsy?

71
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.980
Did you export them, and examine them,
but not the third party tool?

72
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.640
What did you do?

73
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.300
And then we want to have
the interpretation of our findings.

74
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.674
You may find information in
the Windows registry just for example.

75
00:03:52.674 --> 00:03:54.817
And you want to be able to interpret that.

76
00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:58.521
When you're doing your report or
investigation.

77
00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:03.263
Make sure you're answering each of
the questions that pertained to your

78
00:04:03.263 --> 00:04:05.220
particular investigation.

79
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.760
If the question is,
was there malware on the system?

80
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.484
You want to make sure that you
can find out whether there was,

81
00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.952
or there was not malware on the system.

82
00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:18.353
And you might want to look in some
of your persistent artifacts,

83
00:04:18.353 --> 00:04:22.599
to see if you can see anything
that was set to a run at startup.

84
00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.740
That you know is known malware.

85
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.940
You might want to run a virus program,
something that virus total against it.

86
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.893
So you want to answer your questions.

87
00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:35.601
And you want to support
your opinions with facts,

88
00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:38.251
and artifacts that you
find in the file system.

89
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.122
We want to document the examination
software tools we use, and

90
00:04:43.122 --> 00:04:46.440
what versions of the tools we were using.

91
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.891
And you want to make sure you read
the release notes on these tools.

92
00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:54.249
So if they're already known issues,
you know about it ahead of time.

93
00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.532
You want to be able to explain
anything you include in your report.

94
00:04:57.532 --> 00:05:00.871
Never put anything in a report
that you cannot explain.

95
00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:08.040
And if you make a mistake own up to it,
don't try to leave it out, or sweep it by.

96
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.316
If you make a mistake, document it, and
continue on with your investigation.

97
00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:18.119
Report considerations, stay away from
using statements like, always, and never,

98
00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:21.299
because when we're talking
about computer forensics.

99
00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:26.919
There are very few things that will fall
into the category of always being one way,

100
00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.940
or never being one way.

101
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.820
A lot of it depends as part
of computer forensics.

102
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.140
Be careful about attributing
who was the user.

103
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.763
Because just because somebody logged
on with somebody's credentials.

104
00:05:40.763 --> 00:05:44.770
You're going to need a little more
supportive evidence than that to say,

105
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.729
that this particular person was
the one sitting behind the keyboard.

106
00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.182
And it's okay to say you don't know,
inconclusive happens.

107
00:05:54.182 --> 00:05:59.272
A good example is this,
if you found graphic files

108
00:05:59.272 --> 00:06:04.251
in internet cache,
temporary internet files.

109
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:08.089
You can say, that at some point
that website was visited.

110
00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:12.462
But you cannot say, that those images were
downloaded to the computer by the user.

111
00:06:12.462 --> 00:06:15.885
Or that the user had knowledge that
those images were on the computer.

112
00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:18.337
So you do want to be careful.

113
00:06:18.337 --> 00:06:25.550
In our next module, module two, we're
going to look at tools generated reports
