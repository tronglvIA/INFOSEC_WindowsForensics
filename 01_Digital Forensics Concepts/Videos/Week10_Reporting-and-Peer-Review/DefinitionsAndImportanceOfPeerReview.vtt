00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
Welcome back, to digital
forensic concepts.

2
00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:05.730
In this course, we are talking

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.475
about reporting in peer review.

4
00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.575
In this module, Module 3,

5
00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:11.895
we're going to talk about

6
00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:15.000
the definition and the
importance of peer review.

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.520
Peer review is defined by SWEDG,

8
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.875
the scientific working group as,

9
00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:25.625
an evaluation conducted by a
second qualified examiner,

10
00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.740
of reports, notes, data,

11
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.640
conclusions, and other documents.

12
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.120
Peer review ensures
the reliability

13
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.665
and validity of findings
and conclusions.

14
00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:43.605
Peer review is when another
qualified examiner,

15
00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:48.155
looks at the results of
your forensic examination,

16
00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:52.099
and decides whether
they think it is valid,

17
00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:53.855
that it makes sense,

18
00:00:53.855 --> 00:00:57.685
that it's reproducible,
and that it is correct.

19
00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:00.620
They may give you back
some suggestions,

20
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.070
constructive criticism, but
it's a way of learning.

21
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.814
Peer review has been proven,

22
00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:10.415
to increase the reliability
and accuracy of reports.

23
00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:14.130
Next slide. Most of us will
have peer review in our labs.

24
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.130
If we're working in a
lab-based environment,

25
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.400
this is the primary area
where peer review happens,

26
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.220
and that's when you have
another examiner in your lab,

27
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.580
look at your report
and your findings.

28
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.030
It is known to reduce errors.

29
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.930
It should be part of
every examination.

30
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.565
It is extremely important,

31
00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:33.530
because you want to
find the mistakes

32
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.595
before you turn in
your final report,

33
00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:38.915
your presentation,

34
00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.470
or whoever is going to
be looking at your work.

35
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.225
Whether it's your boss,

36
00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:46.265
if you're doing it for a clients,

37
00:01:46.265 --> 00:01:48.425
if you're turning it
into a lawyer's office,

38
00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:51.130
you really want to have
some type of peer review,

39
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.200
to have that report and
those findings looked at,

40
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.210
by another qualified examiner
before you turn them over.

41
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.165
Benefits of peer review.

42
00:02:00.165 --> 00:02:03.980
Well, it helps give us some
scientific credential,

43
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.625
because after all this
is a scientific process.

44
00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:14.065
In the case, Daubert versus
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,

45
00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:16.920
peer review, was one of

46
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.685
the tests for
admissibility of evidence.

47
00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:23.090
Peer review is also one of
the best ways to overcome and

48
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.710
prevent potential errors in

49
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.615
our reports, like I said before.

50
00:02:26.615 --> 00:02:29.345
But there wasn't admissibility
tests for evidence,

51
00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:31.345
set forth in a case and that's,

52
00:02:31.345 --> 00:02:34.885
Daubert versus Merrell
Dow Pharmaceuticals,

53
00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:38.010
where peer review was
actually part of that test,

54
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.180
to consider whether evidence

55
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.300
would or would not be admissible.

56
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.700
That's how important
peer review is.

57
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.395
I just want to
really stress that.

58
00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:49.450
It's also one of the
best ways to overcome

59
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.945
and prevent potential
biases in our report.

60
00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:57.190
We all are human beings and
we do have our own biases.

61
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.995
If you have another objective,

62
00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:03.175
professional look at your
report and your findings,

63
00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:04.990
they can do it from
a way that might

64
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.150
not be clouded with
certain biases,

65
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.090
that you may or may not have.

66
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.930
But it does help prevent

67
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.210
these biases from becoming
part of our report.

68
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.640
It does offer a way to

69
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.860
improve the quality
of future work.

70
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.290
Like I said before,
constructive criticism,

71
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.075
we can learn to improve,

72
00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:25.220
when we have another
professional look

73
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.350
at our reports and
give us feedback.

74
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.970
I hope you now

75
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.990
understand what peer review
is and why it's important.
