00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.560
>> Welcome back to digital
forensic concepts.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.840
In this course, we're talking
about Keyword incorrect searching.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.350
In this module, Module four,
we're going to talk about Keyword

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.340
searching with the open
source tool Autopsy.

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.440
Autopsy has built in
keywords capabilities.

6
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.580
You can search for an exact match.

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.440
You can search for a substring match and
you can search using regular expression.

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.706
Like we talked about in our last module.

9
00:00:32.706 --> 00:00:38.740
Autopsy has built in and
user created keyword lists.

10
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.940
You can use the built in keyword lists or
you can create your own keyword list.

11
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.745
It also has built in regular expressions
for phone numbers, IP addresses,

12
00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:54.540
email addresses, URL's and
credit card numbers.

13
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.350
We're going to do a demo with autopsy,
and we're going to do some keywords and

14
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.140
grew up searches.

15
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.575
The version of autopsy
we're using is 4.170 and

16
00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:10.940
we're going to use the Ivan the mdk image.

17
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.300
Let's start our walk through.

18
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.240
>> Hello and welcome to our keyword
searching with autopsy demo.

19
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.961
As you can see.

20
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:21.025
We've opened up autopsy And

21
00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:26.840
our version is 4.17.0 which is
the most recent version of autopsy.

22
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.880
We can see up here in
the right hand corner.

23
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.680
We have a selection called keyword lists.

24
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.643
And if we click on that, we can see
we have built in keyword lists and

25
00:01:37.643 --> 00:01:41.368
they are regular expressions for
phone numbers,

26
00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:46.840
IP addresses, email addresses URL's and
credit card numbers.

27
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.540
Now you can search for
as many of these as you like at one time.

28
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.950
You can also go to manage lists and
you can create a new list.

29
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.250
You would have to name it.

30
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.667
And we're going to name our list hacking,
and we're going to say Ok.

31
00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:08.050
And now we can create our new keywords And
we'll just put some keywords in here.

32
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.640
Hacking, hackers, Russian grid and
we could keep going on.

33
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.981
There are also some drugs in this case.

34
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:19.820
So we could use the word drugs, narcotics.

35
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.817
And you have the choice of doing
an exact match, a sub string match,

36
00:02:23.817 --> 00:02:25.590
which would be part of a word.

37
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.550
Or we can use the regular expression, but
we didn't choose regular expressions.

38
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.504
But we could have, we say Ok.

39
00:02:31.504 --> 00:02:33.940
And it creates our list hacking.

40
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.290
So now when we reopen keyword lists, we
see our hacking keyword list here, and we

41
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.510
can choose that and we can choose search
and it will search for those keywords.

42
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.340
We can also do a keyword search,
for just a single word.

43
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.056
And in this case I'm going
to use the word hacking, and

44
00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:52.910
I'm going to go with an exact match.

45
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.896
And I'm going to click search, and
we can see we get a lot of hits right away

46
00:02:57.896 --> 00:03:01.940
in the web cache artifacts and
we can see we get a lot of hits.

47
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.140
We have 350 hits right off the bat.

48
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.913
Now I'm going to go back to my keyword
lists and we choose my hacking list, and

49
00:03:08.913 --> 00:03:12.687
I'm going to click search, and this is
going to take a little bit longer because

50
00:03:12.687 --> 00:03:16.260
it's searching more than one key word,
when it comes back pretty fast.

51
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.152
And now we can see our hits and
when we click on one of our files,

52
00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:23.990
we can see the hit highlighted.

53
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.262
We can see the file that comes from, and
it gives us information about the file

54
00:03:28.262 --> 00:03:32.240
like the creative date and
some other information down below.

55
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.480
And we have a full path to the file,
and this is in web cache.

56
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.130
We also have web history and
it tells us the URL, the title,

57
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.524
this was a download tells us the program
that it was downloaded with,

58
00:03:46.524 --> 00:03:48.770
and the domain it came from.

59
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.810
Okay, now we're going to
do some grip searches.

60
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.519
So we're going to use our
keyword search list, and

61
00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.240
we're going to do some phone number
searches and some email address searches.

62
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.550
And we're going to go ahead and
search and see what we get for hits.

63
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.220
And we have 114 results.

64
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.231
And let's take a look.

65
00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:12.326
This is email and we can see we've
got a Vladimir Oler email address,

66
00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:17.640
and we have the Ivan zero
democracy email address.

67
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.983
You notice that Vladimir has a .RU.

68
00:04:19.983 --> 00:04:23.440
That usually means it's
coming from Russia.

69
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:31.840
And we also found another email
address agendas6120 @gmail.com.

70
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.850
So you can go through here and
find some email addresses.

71
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.420
You can look at account artifacts and
we have some reg ripper results.

72
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.140
We have a new email address,
djohndeb2005@gmail.com.

73
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.528
And we have our path,

74
00:04:47.528 --> 00:04:52.240
we don't seem to have any phone
numbers in this particular image.

75
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.791
And we can go ahead and
we could do a search for I.

76
00:04:55.791 --> 00:05:00.901
P addresses and you can see these hits
because of the way the IP address.

77
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.840
This is not an IP address.

78
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.799
But because of the way that
regular expression is written,

79
00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:08.311
it is hitting on this.

80
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:13.114
Because remember it was one or three and
a dot one or three on the 30.1 or

81
00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:17.159
three on the 30.1 or
three on the dot, and this is 111.

82
00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.881
So you are going to get
some false hits and

83
00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:23.084
you will get that with
keyword searching tool,

84
00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:27.630
you'll get hits on Keywords that
may not be related to your case.

85
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.173
So we can uncheck that one and
we can look at URL's and search, and

86
00:05:32.173 --> 00:05:37.635
I'm sure we will get quite a bit back on
URL's and start the search completes.

87
00:05:37.635 --> 00:05:42.487
And we've got something in web
bookmarks and this gives us the URL,

88
00:05:42.487 --> 00:05:45.892
the title,
the date the bookmark was created,

89
00:05:45.892 --> 00:05:52.240
the application that created it which
is Internet Explorer and the domain.

90
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.440
Again we have web history
which we've seen before.

91
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.230
We have the URL.

92
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.598
The access state,
the reference URL and the domain.

93
00:06:01.598 --> 00:06:04.132
And we have cookies, Web cookies and

94
00:06:04.132 --> 00:06:08.240
we'll talk more about what
cookies are in another course.

95
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.040
But we do have the WWW Wired.com.

96
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.240
We have the date and time.

97
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.790
We have a name.

98
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.140
We have the process program
name which is Firefox.

99
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.630
So we've seen Firefox, Chrome and
Internet Explorer running.

100
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.230
So this gives us an idea of what
browses are installed also.

101
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.710
And we have a date that
this cookie was created.

102
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.240
So this website was visited on
the state when the cookie was created.

103
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.990
And we have the domain name.

104
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.440
So you can get quite a bit of
information out of these hits.

105
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.740
We found email addresses,
we've seen websites visited.

106
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.054
It's also web form history artifact, and

107
00:06:49.054 --> 00:06:53.900
we can see the domain,
the date created and the date access.

108
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.140
You can see a web search artifact.

109
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.701
And the text was Russian hack
is what he was searching for.

110
00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:04.976
And that was with the Firefox browser and
that is the date and time of the search,

111
00:07:04.976 --> 00:07:09.940
is also a hit in recent docks and
we have the path and the date and time.

112
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.540
We have web cache and in our web cache
we have the date that was created.

113
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.020
We have the data expires and
we have our URL.

114
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.640
And that's we're actually
getting a hit on is the URL.

115
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.830
We do have 1002.

116
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.240
I'm sorry.
We have 12,039 hits.

117
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.500
So this would be a lot
to go through manually.

118
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.420
You might want to narrow your
search criteria little bit.

119
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.685
We also have a hit in our red ripper
report, and we have that email address,

120
00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:43.940
and it's hitting in the SAM
file under a user Dennis.

121
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.440
So just from doing these keyword searches
we were able to get email addresses.

122
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:54.640
We were able to see domains that
the user visited with dates and times.

123
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.730
We're able to see bookmarks,
what he had on his bookmarks bar,

124
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.030
which might be interesting to us.

125
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:05.696
And with the web cookie,
the date on the cookie shows

126
00:08:05.696 --> 00:08:10.230
that a website,
this happens to be google.com.

127
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.830
But it does show us the date it
was visited, the date and time.

128
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:18.780
We've also found out that there
were three different browsers used.

129
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:24.090
And this is just from doing
a URL regular expression search.

130
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.575
If we search our hacking keyword list,
and I am going to go ahead and

131
00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:33.473
go to the top of this list, and
I'm going to sort on names for a minute,

132
00:08:33.473 --> 00:08:38.481
when I'm trying to find downloads but
I'm not seeing some right here.

133
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:44.346
But we do have recent documents and he
have a drugs hit on our drugs keyword and

134
00:08:44.346 --> 00:08:49.021
this is in the sea users Ivan
downloads drug dealing 101 We

135
00:08:49.021 --> 00:08:53.991
can see it's a recent document but
it is coming from downloads.

136
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:59.930
These are coming from downloads, and this
is the hit on grid, grid cyber attack.

137
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.905
And we can see the date and
time, is a hit on our hacking,

138
00:09:03.905 --> 00:09:09.000
hacking the US tried it, pdf and
that would be in Ivan's google drive.

139
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.174
So we now know there's a google drive and
play, and we have a date and

140
00:09:12.174 --> 00:09:14.840
time when it was accessed
on the google drive.

141
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.840
This is the basics of hacking and
penetration pdf.

142
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.178
And again it's in downloads,, and
we have date and time it was accessed, and

143
00:09:23.178 --> 00:09:26.240
we still will have our
Mac times are modified.

144
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.740
Change time is referring to a change
made to the master file table.

145
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.461
Access time and created time and

146
00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:39.021
they are all pretty much the same and
our web auto fill artifacts.

147
00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:42.564
We have a search history for
images of drugs,

148
00:09:42.564 --> 00:09:47.440
drug images and we have a date and
time when that was done.

149
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.545
So keyword searches do give
us a lot of information and

150
00:09:51.545 --> 00:09:56.140
they're going to add a lot
of relevance to our cases.

151
00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.631
There's a lot of things you're going to
find in a keyword search that you might

152
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:03.898
not find had you just manually
look through the different

153
00:10:03.898 --> 00:10:05.682
artifacts in the file system.

154
00:10:05.682 --> 00:10:10.090
And we will cover this in another path,
all the artifacts in the file system.

155
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:15.450
In our next course, we're going to
cover report writing and peer review.

156
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.081
End of demonstration.
