00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Hello, and welcome back to
digital forensic concepts.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.600
In this course, course 9,

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.170
we're going to talk about
keyword in grep searches.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.680
In this course, we're
going to cover how

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.205
to formulate case-specific
keyword lists,

6
00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:20.580
a review of grep
and extended grep,

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.815
what they are and how they work.

8
00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.960
We're also going to look at using

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.850
practical graph expressions

10
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.950
and extended grep expressions.

11
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.230
We're also going
to take a look at

12
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.120
keyword searching in

13
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.735
the free and open-source
tool autopsy.

14
00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.015
In module 1, we're going to cover

15
00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:40.725
keyword in grep searches.

16
00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.560
When you're looking
at a case and you're

17
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.200
choosing a keyword list,

18
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.320
you want to think
about the type of

19
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.420
incident or a fence
you're investigating.

20
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360
If you're not the case, agent,

21
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.250
you definitely want
to speak to them.

22
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.480
If you're not investigating,

23
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.775
you want to talk to
that person to find out

24
00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:01.735
information regarding the case
that you're investigating.

25
00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:05.015
We want to formulate
our keyword searches

26
00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:09.245
around the elements
of the investigation.

27
00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:11.340
What happened in this instance?

28
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.195
We want to include
any existing leads

29
00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:17.770
or names of suspects or
people who may be involved.

30
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.300
We want to take a look
at our suspects and

31
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.790
find out stuff about
them personally.

32
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.160
This can help us locate

33
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.835
possible information
to break passwords.

34
00:01:27.835 --> 00:01:32.075
We definitely want to look
at case-specific keywords,

35
00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:35.750
keywords that will be useful
in this one particular case.

36
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.795
They're specific
to that one case.

37
00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:40.280
Now a keyword searching, we

38
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.125
generally have two categories.

39
00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:44.105
We have generic keywords.

40
00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:48.275
Keywords that are generic
to a specific type of case,

41
00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.050
like maybe a drug case or

42
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.300
maybe a theft of
intellectual property case.

43
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.870
Then we have
case-specific keywords,

44
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.620
and a case-specific keyword
is a keyword that is specific

45
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.620
to that one particular
case you're investigating.

46
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.750
That may be something like

47
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.230
suspect names or people
who involve names.

48
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.505
You can get generic
case keyword lists

49
00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:16.650
from the URL I have up
here on the screen.

50
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.480
DIF or training,
DIF or resources.

51
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.580
If you belong to any groups,

52
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.980
you can check your list servers.

53
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.270
If you are in law
enforcement, ICAC,

54
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.780
Internet crimes against children

55
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.460
has keyword lists that you can

56
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.410
download and you can get

57
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.635
keyword lists from other
forensic examiners.

58
00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:39.720
There are some limitations to

59
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.170
text-based keyword searching and

60
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.410
some of these are a bit shifting.

61
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.205
Bit shifting is when you

62
00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:48.530
alter the data at
the binary level,

63
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.215
somebody goes in with
a hex editor and

64
00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:54.410
alternates the data
at that binary level.

65
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.880
It will also cause
you to not be able to

66
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.590
search your file using

67
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.395
a text-based search scheme
if the file is encrypted.

68
00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:05.150
Because remember encryption,

69
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.920
we're not looking at plain tasks.

70
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.235
That text is scrambled
using an algorithm,

71
00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:12.425
so the file is encrypted.

72
00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:15.710
Compressed files will also not be

73
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.920
able to be searched with
text-based keyword searching,

74
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.450
you would have to decompress

75
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.920
the file before you
could search it.

76
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.390
That's anything like a zip
file or an archive file.

77
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.504
Also, non-keyboard characters
or non-word characters

78
00:03:31.504 --> 00:03:36.395
can be used to hide files
from keyword searching.

79
00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:39.815
What I mean by using
non-word characters,

80
00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:41.090
if we take a look at the slide,

81
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.929
if I'm looking for the
keywords, resume or bio,

82
00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.000
maybe I'm doing an intellectual

83
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.340
property theft case
where somebody was

84
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.040
applying to a competitor and

85
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.615
going to take some of the
information with them.

86
00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:56.240
If I put it into words, resume,

87
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.240
or bio, all I'm going to
find are those words.

88
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.980
It's not going to
hit on things like,

89
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.085
you see the re5um3.

90
00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:09.270
It would not find that and
it would not find the b!0.

91
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.180
If I was searching for
an IP address but I

92
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.760
didn't know what IP addresses

93
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.530
are important to my case yet,

94
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.480
I would have to do a lot
of keyword searches,

95
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.545
just searching for
individual IP addresses.

96
00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:27.695
This is where our pattern
matching comes in.

97
00:04:27.695 --> 00:04:30.095
Our patents searches,
grep searches,

98
00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:34.770
which we're going to talk
about in our next module.
