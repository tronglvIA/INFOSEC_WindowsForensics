00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.795
Hello, and welcome back to
the computer forensics path,

2
00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:06.495
Course 7, Module 2.

3
00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:08.385
In this module, we're
going to look at

4
00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:12.270
live versus dead box
evidence collection.

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.810
This is collecting from
a live running machine

6
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.935
versus collecting from
a machine that is off.

7
00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:23.160
Some of our considerations when

8
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.100
deciding whether to collect from

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.710
a live running machine or

10
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.500
go ahead and power down
the machine and do

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.725
a traditional dead box collection
would be volatile data,

12
00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:41.640
specifically RAM,
random access memory.

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.424
Encryption; if
encryption is running,

14
00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:48.160
we're going to want
to collect that live.

15
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.105
Our inability to shut
down the system;

16
00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:52.790
some systems cannot be

17
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.010
shut down for one
reason or another.

18
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.660
We talked about the example of

19
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.595
a business with servers
that we cannot shut down.

20
00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:02.505
The size of the data;

21
00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:04.355
if we're dealing with big data,

22
00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:06.635
we're going to be doing
a large collection,

23
00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:08.390
and we talked about that
when we talked about

24
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.865
big data and the
challenges of big data.

25
00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.690
Cloud storage, social media;

26
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.800
we would have to
access those accounts

27
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.899
through a live running computer

28
00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.245
and capture that information
from the live machine.

29
00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:28.505
Remember to stay within the
scope of your legal process.

30
00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:32.720
Know what you have named
in your search warrant,

31
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.230
and make sure you stay
within those limitations.

32
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.960
This is the definition
of volatile data.

33
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.185
Basically, it's data
that goes away or

34
00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:45.830
is eradicated when the
device powers down.

35
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.020
If the device loses power,

36
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.140
that information is gone.

37
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.680
That random access
memory is gone forever,

38
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.780
it's not going to come back when

39
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.920
you turn the machine back on.

40
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.400
Another way of defining it,

41
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.115
it could be the data that
is not written to disk.

42
00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:04.745
Because remember, if you're
doing a dead box collection,

43
00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:06.920
you're collecting
only the data that

44
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.170
has been written to the disk.

45
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.140
Examples would be RAM,

46
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.220
random access memory, which
I talked about before.

47
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.180
One thing to be aware of
with RAM is there are

48
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.295
certain malware that
will only run in RAM.

49
00:02:24.295 --> 00:02:27.605
If we're doing an
incident response case

50
00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.370
and we're looking
for that type of

51
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.450
malware and we don't

52
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.639
collect RAM and we
power down our machine,

53
00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.780
we're going to lose
that information.

54
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.780
Certain registry keys
only exist in RAM.

55
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.210
Our list of running processes,

56
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.225
the processes that are currently
running on the machine,

57
00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:49.745
and network connections,

58
00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:53.370
the devices that are
connected to the network.

59
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.150
RAM, always collect RAM,
random access memory.

60
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.260
If a computer is on and you

61
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.835
have the ability to collect RAM,

62
00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:03.295
you need to do so.

63
00:03:03.295 --> 00:03:06.350
Modern computers
contain anywhere from

64
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.545
eight gigabytes of RAM up
to 96 gigabytes of RAM.

65
00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:13.085
It is no longer acceptable
to not collect it.

66
00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:16.435
You're going to be questioned
on why you didn't.

67
00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:18.330
In an intrusion in

68
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.735
incident response cases,
RAM is essential.

69
00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:23.490
These cases rely heavily on

70
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.160
random access memory because we

71
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.505
need to see the
network connections,

72
00:03:27.505 --> 00:03:29.660
we need to see the
running processes when

73
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.760
we're doing these types
of investigations,

74
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.470
and we need to see any malware

75
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.360
that may only be
running in memory.

76
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.980
We can see on this
screenshot that

77
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.025
this particular machine
had 64 gigabytes of RAM,

78
00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:45.515
and it's just a desktop computer.

79
00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:48.680
You wouldn't leave a
64-gigabyte thumb drive

80
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.835
sitting on the desk,

81
00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:53.465
you shouldn't leave 64
gigabytes of RAM behind.

82
00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:57.080
There are many RAM
capture tools out there.

83
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.775
Here's a list of some of them.

84
00:03:58.775 --> 00:04:02.084
Magnet has one, DumpIt,

85
00:04:02.084 --> 00:04:07.930
Belkasoft, and FTK Imager is
capable of capturing RAM.

86
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.025
This is a screenshot of DumpIt,

87
00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:14.975
very easy to use, very efficient.

88
00:04:14.975 --> 00:04:17.150
One thing to consider,

89
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.430
it has a very small footprint

90
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.680
since it is a command-line tool.

91
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.560
If you're using a GUI tool,

92
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.735
graphical user interface tool,

93
00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:30.575
it's going to leave a bigger
footprint on the system.

94
00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:33.785
If you can use a
command-line tool,

95
00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:35.720
you're better off because it will

96
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.190
leave a smaller footprint.

97
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.645
At the end of this module,

98
00:04:41.645 --> 00:04:46.450
we'll show you a live
demonstration of DumpIt.

99
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.590
Encryption is another one of

100
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.270
the things we need to
consider when we're

101
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.425
deciding whether or not we're
going to do live imaging.

102
00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:57.200
Encryption is defined
as the process of

103
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.705
randomizing data to
make it unreadable.

104
00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:01.580
This is a way we secure our data

105
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.660
to prevent unauthorized access.

106
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.310
Encryption can be
applied to files,

107
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.860
containers, volumes, or disks.

108
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.345
You can have an encrypted
file, a container,

109
00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:16.554
an entire volume or
full disk encryption.

110
00:05:16.554 --> 00:05:19.255
A lot of operating systems

111
00:05:19.255 --> 00:05:21.640
including Windows 10 and
the latest release of

112
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.450
Mac OSX have the capabilities

113
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.390
of encrypting any of
these or all of these.

114
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.890
We're going to look for

115
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.200
encryption and we
can see on the slide

116
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.195
the graphics show us
examples of encryption.

117
00:05:37.195 --> 00:05:39.610
We're going to check
our taskbar and

118
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.005
our system tray and we're
going to see what is running.

119
00:05:44.005 --> 00:05:50.305
If you see an icon like you
see on the very far right,

120
00:05:50.305 --> 00:05:54.140
that is a BitLocker
encrypted drive.

121
00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.760
We can also see an example
of cystine, PGP encryption,

122
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.865
and those other icons

123
00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:08.480
are also showing you
indications of encryption.

124
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.990
If you have no indication
of encryption,

125
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.989
if you have a suspicion
of encryption,

126
00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:25.810
I would go ahead and check
to see what's going on.

127
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.340
On a Windows system,

128
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.155
it's very easy,

129
00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:32.035
if you look at the graphic
on the right here.

130
00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:34.450
You are interacting and making

131
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.255
changes to the system
but document it.

132
00:06:37.255 --> 00:06:40.645
Document use expected there
was encryption running

133
00:06:40.645 --> 00:06:45.140
because you know in Windows
10 BitLocker is enabled.

134
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.295
Here we go to the bottom

135
00:06:48.295 --> 00:06:51.145
in the Windows 10
and type in "bit",

136
00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:55.780
you'll see the BitLocker
control panel.

137
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.575
You would go ahead and check
the BitLocker control panel.

138
00:06:59.575 --> 00:07:01.330
When you open it up,
you're going to see

139
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.690
a graphics almost the one
we have on the screen.

140
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:13.790
We can see here that
BitLocker is turned off,

141
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.155
so you would know

142
00:07:20.155 --> 00:07:23.440
that you had no BitLocker
drives up here,

143
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.730
but wait a second,

144
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.535
if we look at this
removable drive R,

145
00:07:27.535 --> 00:07:29.890
BitLocker is turned on.

146
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.230
So we know volume

147
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.445
R is an encrypted volume
that right now is unlocked.

148
00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:38.020
If I saw that,

149
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.650
I would want to go
ahead and live image,

150
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:47.410
logical volume R. Because

151
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.720
if I don't and I shut
this machine down,

152
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.160
I power it off,

153
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.010
BitLocker will kick in and I may

154
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.385
not be able to get
back into their drive.

155
00:07:57.385 --> 00:08:00.790
This is going to be my only
shot at that evidence.

156
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:08.125
I'm going to go ahead and
create my live image,

157
00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:13.645
I'm also going to go ahead
and back up the recovery key,

158
00:08:13.645 --> 00:08:16.105
as you can see here on
the right-hand side.

159
00:08:16.105 --> 00:08:20.305
We can save that
recovery key to a file,

160
00:08:20.305 --> 00:08:22.975
now you're going to go
ahead and save that

161
00:08:22.975 --> 00:08:26.395
out to your target media,

162
00:08:26.395 --> 00:08:28.360
your destination drive,

163
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.820
where you're collecting
your evidence,

164
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.770
the same place you would put

165
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:38.630
your logical image of
the BitLocker R drive.

166
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.174
In our next module,

167
00:08:42.174 --> 00:08:43.780
we're going to talk about

168
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.710
live imaging in
forensic boot media,

169
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:53.935
now we're going to do
a demo using DumpIt.

170
00:08:53.935 --> 00:08:57.685
This is a live
demonstration of DumpIt.

171
00:08:57.685 --> 00:09:00.580
DumpIt is a very simple program,

172
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.710
it is a command line program

173
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.714
which you can go ahead and
double-click on the Shortcut,

174
00:09:09.714 --> 00:09:12.235
mine is right down
here in my taskbar.

175
00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:14.725
If I double-click on that,

176
00:09:14.725 --> 00:09:17.650
DumpIt is going to run.

177
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.875
Now, it's going to ask me
if I want to continue,

178
00:09:20.875 --> 00:09:23.875
it's going to show me the size

179
00:09:23.875 --> 00:09:25.929
of the memory that
I'm collecting,

180
00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:29.380
and it's going to show me
where it is putting the files.

181
00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.279
It's putting it at C Users
Denise desktop OneDrive,

182
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.025
and it's naming the file
the name of the computer,

183
00:09:40.025 --> 00:09:42.275
a date and timestamp,

184
00:09:42.275 --> 00:09:44.685
and it's called a.raw,

185
00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:47.490
R-A-W will be the file extension.

186
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.050
I would simply hit the "Y"
and it starts working.

187
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.375
When it's completed
it is going to

188
00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:57.460
save the file right here.

189
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.490
You can change that if you had

190
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.200
an external destination drive

191
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.225
that you are saving
all your evidence to.

192
00:10:04.225 --> 00:10:09.220
You would go ahead and
save that file out there.

193
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.530
I'm not going to let
this run through

194
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.365
because there's quite a bit
of memory on this machine.

195
00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:17.605
But I just wanted to give
you a quick look at DumpIt,

196
00:10:17.605 --> 00:10:21.770
we will be using this
throughout the path.
