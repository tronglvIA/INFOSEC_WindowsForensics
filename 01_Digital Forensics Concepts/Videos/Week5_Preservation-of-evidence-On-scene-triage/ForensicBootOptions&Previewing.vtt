00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.097
Hello, and

2
00:00:01.097 --> 00:00:07.137
welcome back to course seven module
three of the computer forensics path.

3
00:00:07.137 --> 00:00:13.051
In this module, we're going to discuss
live imaging and forensic boot media.

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.440
Live imaging,
why would we need to live image?

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.684
Well, we could be dealing
with an encrypted drive, or

6
00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:27.298
an encrypted volume or
just some encrypted files may be open

7
00:00:27.298 --> 00:00:32.740
in RAM currently that we want to
create a logical image of.

8
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.148
We would also want to collect RAM,
but collecting RAM and

9
00:00:36.148 --> 00:00:38.351
live imaging are not the same thing.

10
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.419
Another reason why we may need to live
image is that the system can't be

11
00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:45.201
shut down.

12
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.240
When we are doing live imaging,

13
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.850
we are getting a logical image of
a logical volume or a logical drive.

14
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.159
You're not getting that full disk image
from sector zero all the way to the end of

15
00:00:59.159 --> 00:00:59.751
the disk.

16
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.750
We're going to use our imaging
software from an external drive.

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.990
We're not going to run our imaging
software from the suspect's computer.

18
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.740
You would use something like
FDK light on a thumb drive.

19
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.061
And there are other imaging
softwares that we can use.

20
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.536
We're going to send that
image that we've created to

21
00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:28.055
an external sterilized target media,

22
00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:32.651
which we are then going to
take with us from the scene.

23
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.480
We want to make sure that our target
media is large enough to contain

24
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.761
all the data that we want to put on it.

25
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.687
And again, the reasons we would do this
is if the hard drive is not removable,

26
00:01:48.687 --> 00:01:50.882
we had some type of encryption.

27
00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:52.402
And the Surface Pro and

28
00:01:52.402 --> 00:01:58.660
MacBook would be examples of computers
where the hard drives are not removable.

29
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.531
The chicks decided to the board and
I think we're going to see more and

30
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:03.380
more of this.

31
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.662
So live imaging, I think it's going to
become something of a standard practice.

32
00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:16.283
Dead box forensics,
this is if you find the computer off or

33
00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:22.725
when you perform a normal shutdown
after you've collected ramp.

34
00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:27.309
You would remove the hard drive, attach
the hard drive to your write blocker,

35
00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:28.975
and you would have tested and

36
00:02:28.975 --> 00:02:33.025
validated your write blocker prior
to going on your search warrant.

37
00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:38.920
Then you're going to attach your write
blocker to your forensic computer,

38
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.461
and then you're going to copy your
evidence, two sterile target media.

39
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.688
And when I say sterile target media,

40
00:02:48.688 --> 00:02:52.890
I mean media that is wiped and
confirmed to be wiped.

41
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.340
Not something that you ran a format on.

42
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.321
And just because you buy a brand-new
disk out of the box does not mean it is

43
00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:01.450
completely clean.

44
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.836
You need to wipe the media with something
like kill disk, and then check and

45
00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:11.797
verify that it is indeed completely
white with some type of algorithm

46
00:03:11.797 --> 00:03:16.259
not visually looking at it
because you could miss something.

47
00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:22.697
Forensic proof media, this is a little
different then dead box forensics and

48
00:03:22.697 --> 00:03:27.847
a little different than the other
method of live imaging I just

49
00:03:27.847 --> 00:03:32.819
described what we would use FBK
imagery from a thumb drive.

50
00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.741
Forensic boot media is when we're
actually the computer is either off or

51
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:41.761
has gone through a normal shutdown.

52
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.449
We are going to reboot this computer
into a forensic environment,

53
00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:54.140
and that is usually some type of
modified Lennox Operating System.

54
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.540
With the exception of
windows forensic environment.

55
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.453
Win FE is not a Lennox distribution, but

56
00:04:02.453 --> 00:04:08.438
we can see the other software
is listed on the screen paladin,

57
00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:16.861
cane, helix, and penguinSleuth are all
some type of modified Lennox distribution.

58
00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:24.710
When you were doing booting from
forensic group media, you want to make

59
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.140
sure you do some research on the computer
that you're going to be booting up.

60
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.138
You need to find out which key
will get you into the bios, so

61
00:04:36.138 --> 00:04:41.343
you can change the boot order
because if you don't do that and

62
00:04:41.343 --> 00:04:43.707
you just boot up normally.

63
00:04:43.707 --> 00:04:46.950
And the boot order says boot
from the hard drive first and

64
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.886
your external media secondary.

65
00:04:48.886 --> 00:04:52.744
You're going to boot into
the operating system and

66
00:04:52.744 --> 00:04:56.799
you're going to be making
changes to that evidence.

67
00:04:56.799 --> 00:05:01.637
And this is what we call stepping
on the evidence, we've all done it,

68
00:05:01.637 --> 00:05:04.340
but we really try not to.

69
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.300
Now you want to make sure
you do this correctly, so

70
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.190
you don't step on the evidence and
if you do, do this correctly.

71
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.125
This is a forensically sound
method of creating a full

72
00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:20.961
disk image or
a logical image you can do either here.

73
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.800
Again, the computer must be shut down and
reboot it.

74
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.917
So this is not collecting ramp because
if you shut down and reboot it,

75
00:05:28.917 --> 00:05:30.061
you've lost your ramp.

76
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.561
You must change the boot
order of the system.

77
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.597
Again, you're going to want to to find
out what he will get you into the bios,

78
00:05:40.597 --> 00:05:45.531
so you can change the boot order to
boot from external media done correctly.

79
00:05:45.531 --> 00:05:49.650
This makes no changes in the original
evidence, it is forensically sound, and

80
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.551
we'll give you the ability
to create a forensic image.

81
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.842
Now come up with Windows 8,
we got that far down the road,

82
00:05:58.842 --> 00:06:03.742
something called UEFI come into
play along with secure boot

83
00:06:03.742 --> 00:06:08.951
unified extended from where
interfaces what UEFI stands for.

84
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.174
But this secure boot and

85
00:06:13.174 --> 00:06:18.696
UEFI prevent the operating system
from booting to external media.

86
00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:27.040
Because secure boot means it can only
boot from assigned operating system.

87
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.994
So all the sign operating
systems can boot, so

88
00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:34.561
when you try to boot from your forensic
boot media, it's going to say no.

89
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.971
Now there is a work around here,
you must go into the bios.

90
00:06:38.971 --> 00:06:41.221
So again you have to know
where the bios key is, and

91
00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:43.740
you're going to have to do some research.

92
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.572
You need to go in there and

93
00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:50.920
change the settings to allow the computer
to boot from removable media.

94
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.213
So we have to disable secure boot and
enable legacy group.

95
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.737
To do this again, we have to get access to
the unified extended firmware interface

96
00:07:05.737 --> 00:07:10.951
to change these settings, and
we would do that through the bios.

97
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.730
This is an example of
a screenshot of paladin.

98
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.734
So this is what it will look
like when we successfully

99
00:07:21.734 --> 00:07:27.440
boot into that forensic
media in this case paladin.

100
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.370
You can see the slide
on the left-hand side,

101
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.923
it has imager find,
it also shows us an allocated and

102
00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:41.835
disk manager will show you all
the drives attached to the computer.

103
00:07:41.835 --> 00:07:46.626
So you can choose which drive you
want to image as your source,

104
00:07:46.626 --> 00:07:50.677
and you can see it but
the top here it's a source, and

105
00:07:50.677 --> 00:07:53.462
we can see the dead in the file path.

106
00:07:53.462 --> 00:08:00.158
And that's going to tell us,
we're looking at some type of Lennox,

107
00:08:00.158 --> 00:08:04.232
and then you're selecting image type.

108
00:08:04.232 --> 00:08:08.162
And then you would select a destination
where is the image going to, and

109
00:08:08.162 --> 00:08:10.661
then you would label
the image created name.

110
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.106
So we have our source,
you have to know where the sources,

111
00:08:19.106 --> 00:08:22.960
you have to know where your
destination is going to be.

112
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.631
Now your source file should be
something on these suspects computer or

113
00:08:28.631 --> 00:08:32.690
something attached to
the suspect's computer.

114
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.907
Your destination drive
is going to be some form

115
00:08:37.907 --> 00:08:45.140
of removable media attached
to your forensic machine.

116
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:50.087
Just make sure you're aware of that and
you're not imaging your own C drive, and

117
00:08:50.087 --> 00:08:53.751
you're not copying the image
to the suspect's computer.

118
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.389
There's also a fine
feature which we did see,

119
00:08:58.389 --> 00:09:02.740
you could use the fines feature
to search for certain keywords.

120
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.270
If you had keywords that you know in
your case, in this case it's bad.

121
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:13.161
The key word was bad stuff, and this shows
you the device that you're searching.

122
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:20.240
You just put a little check mark in
the box, and then you select fine.

123
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.640
This brings us to the end of course seven.

124
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.161
In course eight we're going to
discuss the fat file system.
