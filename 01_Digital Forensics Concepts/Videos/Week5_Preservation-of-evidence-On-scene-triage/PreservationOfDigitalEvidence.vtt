00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.464
Welcome back to the computer
forensics path, Course 7,

2
00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:12.087
we're going to talk about the triage and
preservation of digital evidence.

3
00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:14.727
Preservation of digital evidence.

4
00:00:14.727 --> 00:00:18.626
How do we preserve
the evidence to make little or

5
00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:21.747
no changes to the original evidence?

6
00:00:21.747 --> 00:00:26.436
We're going to talk about live
versus dead box evidence collection.

7
00:00:26.436 --> 00:00:32.333
Whether you're going to be doing a large
live imaging of a logical product or

8
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:36.848
we're going to do the traditional,
remove the hard drive

9
00:00:36.848 --> 00:00:41.381
connected to a write blocker and
create a forensic image.

10
00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:48.916
We're going to define volatile data and
talk about how we capture volatile data,

11
00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:52.964
and we're also going to talk
about forensic boot options.

12
00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:57.996
This is when we would do to some
type of Lennox Destro CD or

13
00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:01.959
maybe a commercial type of USB or
CD drive and

14
00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:06.459
boot into a forensically
sound environment where

15
00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:11.297
we're not making changes
to the original evidence.

16
00:01:12.712 --> 00:01:17.321
In course seven module 1, we're going to
talk about the preservation of digital

17
00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:21.677
evidence, how we preserve the evidence and
what steps we're going to take.

18
00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:24.649
Okay, when we talk about
preservation of evidence,

19
00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.876
what we're talking about is we don't
want to make any changes to the original

20
00:01:28.876 --> 00:01:32.858
evidence and of course we don't
want to destroy the original evidence.

21
00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:37.519
We need to maintain the integrity of
the original evidence from the time we

22
00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:41.216
collected to the time it goes
through court proceedings.

23
00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:45.935
And we do that by working
off of duplicates making

24
00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:50.656
a forensically sound digital copy,
using write

25
00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:55.732
blockers booting into some
type of forensic media.

26
00:01:55.732 --> 00:02:01.964
If we have to do live imaging, there are
situations where we're going to have to

27
00:02:01.964 --> 00:02:07.187
live imaging, it's going to be
expected of us to do live imaging.

28
00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:11.150
And yes, we are going to be making
changes to the original evidence.

29
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.387
What you want to do there is document
what you did and why you did it.

30
00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.832
Document any changes you make
to the original evidence.

31
00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:26.709
And the key to this is knowing
your equipment, your software,

32
00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.100
your forensic software and your
physical equipment and how it works and

33
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.434
explain why you made changes,
why it was necessary to do what you did?

34
00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:40.638
And there's going to be cases where
it's absolutely necessary and

35
00:02:40.638 --> 00:02:43.670
if you don't, you'd be negligent.

36
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.007
If a computer is off,
if you're doing a search,

37
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:47.779
can you find a computer that's off?

38
00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:52.062
Leave it off, don't just turn it on.

39
00:02:52.062 --> 00:02:58.433
You're either going to booted in to
some type of forensic boot media.

40
00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:03.540
Or if you have a device that off,
you're going to remove the hard drive,

41
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.671
if possible, connected to a write
blocker and create a forensic image.

42
00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:14.448
If the devices on here's where
things get a little different,

43
00:03:14.448 --> 00:03:20.122
first of all photograph all
the open windows on the computer.

44
00:03:20.122 --> 00:03:26.235
Note any running applications of
processes, no any destructive processes.

45
00:03:26.235 --> 00:03:30.472
Look for destructive processes,
things like wiping DR0.

46
00:03:30.472 --> 00:03:34.478
Look for signs of encryption,
you're going to see padlocks and

47
00:03:34.478 --> 00:03:36.418
things that looks like locks.

48
00:03:36.418 --> 00:03:39.115
And we're going to collect RAM and

49
00:03:39.115 --> 00:03:44.327
we're going to talk about how we do
all this throughout this course.

50
00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:47.800
This slide shows an example
of just wiping software.

51
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.115
We can see the top one
it's erasing a file and

52
00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:57.282
then the graphic just below that,

53
00:03:57.282 --> 00:04:02.033
we can see that it's erasing disc one.

54
00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:05.018
So if we see something
that looks like this,

55
00:04:05.018 --> 00:04:10.273
we know destructive processes running and
we're going to have to take action.

56
00:04:11.765 --> 00:04:14.789
If you see a destructive process running,

57
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:18.825
immediately pull the plug from
the back of the computer.

58
00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:23.682
Don't pull the plug from the wall because

59
00:04:23.682 --> 00:04:28.677
it could have some type of backup battery,

60
00:04:28.677 --> 00:04:33.833
pull the plug from
the back of the computer.

61
00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:38.308
To look for indication of
running destructive processes,

62
00:04:38.308 --> 00:04:41.087
look down the bottom at the task bar.

63
00:04:41.087 --> 00:04:44.676
Or if the task tray you
can see in the graphic,

64
00:04:44.676 --> 00:04:48.091
you can see the tray,
we see the kill disk.

65
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:54.530
That is the sign for kill disk,
that's their logo is running,

66
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.885
and we can see on the task bar,
kill disk is running.

67
00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:01.946
If you see kill this running,

68
00:05:01.946 --> 00:05:05.743
you want to pull the plug from
the back of the computer.

69
00:05:05.743 --> 00:05:10.944
Once we've determined that a destructive
processes running, we've checked the task

70
00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:15.660
bar, we checked the tray, we see that
there is a destructive process running.

71
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.024
We're going to pull the plug
from the back of the computer.

72
00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:25.479
If you are working with a laptop,
you must also remove the battery.

73
00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:31.078
If you cannot remove the battery,
if it's a Surface Pro or

74
00:05:31.078 --> 00:05:36.222
another laptop where you
cannot remove the battery,

75
00:05:36.222 --> 00:05:42.986
hard shut the computer as fast as you can,
hold down the power button.

76
00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:48.086
Also, another step we're going to take to
preserve the evidence is we're going to

77
00:05:48.086 --> 00:05:53.047
isolate it from radio RF, from wireless
signal and from Bluetooth signal.

78
00:05:53.047 --> 00:05:56.924
So we're going to use some type of
RF shielding like a Faraday bag.

79
00:05:56.924 --> 00:06:03.295
Faraday is a brand name, there are other
companies that make RF shielding bags and

80
00:06:03.295 --> 00:06:09.127
this is to prevent remote wiping of
course and alteration of the evidence.

81
00:06:09.127 --> 00:06:17.241
If we have a device that is powered
on we wanted to stay powered on.

82
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:24.849
So we need a portable battery or
another portable power supply.

83
00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.131
Because power loss can cause data loss,
and

84
00:06:29.131 --> 00:06:33.296
it can also trigger the computer locking,

85
00:06:33.296 --> 00:06:38.748
if it loses power or
can trigger encryption kicking in.

86
00:06:38.748 --> 00:06:46.274
If those encrypted drives were open,
they're not going to be anymore.

87
00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:50.787
So there may be times when you
need to prevent power loss, so

88
00:06:50.787 --> 00:06:53.766
make sure you have a portable battery or

89
00:06:53.766 --> 00:06:58.029
another portable supply with
you in your evidence kit.

90
00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:59.201
Write protection.

91
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:03.358
Always use write protection when
working with the original evidence.

92
00:07:03.358 --> 00:07:07.299
And I'm talking about preview and
live imaging.

93
00:07:07.299 --> 00:07:10.538
Use write protection as much as possible,
and

94
00:07:10.538 --> 00:07:15.033
we're doing this to prevent
changes to the original evidence.

95
00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:19.563
But if you can't use write protection
because there's going to be sometimes and

96
00:07:19.563 --> 00:07:22.427
you can't,
it's just not physically possible,

97
00:07:22.427 --> 00:07:26.233
document the changes that you
are making to the original evidence.

98
00:07:26.233 --> 00:07:31.292
And here is where knowing your software,
knowing your tools comes into play.

99
00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:35.886
So you might have to do some testing and
validating in your lab to figure out what

100
00:07:35.886 --> 00:07:39.032
changes your particular
type of software is making.

101
00:07:39.032 --> 00:07:44.071
I can tell you any time you plug in USB
device into a computer, you're making

102
00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:49.616
changes to the registry and we'll talk
more about that, throughout this course.

103
00:07:49.616 --> 00:07:54.203
In our next module,
we're going to talk about live box

104
00:07:54.203 --> 00:07:57.651
versus dead box evidence collection.
