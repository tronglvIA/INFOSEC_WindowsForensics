00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.396
Welcome back to the computer forensics
path of course four module three.

2
00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:10.251
In this module, we're going to talk
about Search Warrants and Subpoenas.

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.161
What is the role of
the computer in the crime?

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.740
Is the computer and evidence container?

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.859
If it is,
what information are we looking for

6
00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.661
and why do we think it is on the computer?

7
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.400
We have to consider the nature of
the crime that's under investigation.

8
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.040
Is this an ongoing crime?

9
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.561
Is this something that's
going to take multiple warrants?

10
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.250
And what type of computer system
are we going to be looking at?

11
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.440
Is this a stand alone PC?

12
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.860
Is this going to be a network or
is this going to be a server farm?

13
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.213
I mean we need to consider
the type of network

14
00:00:54.213 --> 00:01:00.007
before we get to the place
we're going to search.

15
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:00.996
Warrants.

16
00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:06.050
A warrant is defined as a legal
document authorizing search and

17
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.740
or seizure of property.

18
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.061
He can also authorize the search for
the rest of a person.

19
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.222
In our case we're mainly
talking about search and

20
00:01:17.222 --> 00:01:23.940
seizure of property warrants are issued
upon the legal standard of probable cause.

21
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.634
And again, this is going to be
supported by a written document and so

22
00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:28.651
on to under oath.

23
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.478
A search warrant will authorize the search
of a place to look for evidence,

24
00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:41.761
contraband or stolen property to be
used as evidence in a criminal case.

25
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.740
How are we going to get this warrant?

26
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.269
Well, we need to prepare our affidavit,
which is our written document and

27
00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:55.043
we have to describe the place
we're going to search,

28
00:01:55.043 --> 00:01:59.120
whether it's a home of business or
wherever it may be.

29
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.286
And we're going to describe
the item that we're going to see,

30
00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:04.830
what type of items are we looking for.

31
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.011
And you want to make sure when you do
this, you include every possible item

32
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:17.340
that you could be looking for,
where this data could be stored.

33
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.744
And then we need to
provide probable cause to

34
00:02:20.744 --> 00:02:25.252
show that we believe that the item
is that this location and

35
00:02:25.252 --> 00:02:30.588
that the evidence we're looking for
is going to be found on these item.

36
00:02:30.588 --> 00:02:33.220
Of course you have to get
the warrant signed by a judge.

37
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.496
If you're talking about
an ongoing investigation,

38
00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:41.299
you may want to ask of warrant because
we may need to have multiple search

39
00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.250
warrants depending on the type
of investigation we're doing.

40
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.500
Another consideration is how
are we going to time this?

41
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.301
How are we going to time when
we served the search warrant?

42
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:52.751
We actually execute the warrant.

43
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.870
Well that may differ from
a business to a residence.

44
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.400
If we're talking about a business we may
want to go at the start of the work day.

45
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.251
Some of the reasons could be
because the business is open.

46
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.021
The workforce is on duty.

47
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.741
The people, we want to talk to are there.

48
00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:13.631
We're going to need some type of network
administrator to be present to help us

49
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.240
with this.

50
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.891
The computers are running
they're already up and running.

51
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.831
We do have outside resources available.

52
00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:25.282
If we need to use them you may
need to phone a friend and

53
00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:29.940
call somebody who has dealt
with networks more than you.

54
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.140
Like I said the IT administrators
should be in there during the day.

55
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.640
Yeah and it will allow us for
maximum search time.

56
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.907
This usually does not apply
to law enforcement but

57
00:03:46.907 --> 00:03:50.173
in the private sector most
people work set hours so

58
00:03:50.173 --> 00:03:55.261
if you go at the beginning of the work
that you will maximize your search time.

59
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.961
We also will have
the presence of the suspect.

60
00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:02.740
The suspects should be
there during the work day.

61
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.951
And the reason we might want to do
that is because we would want to

62
00:04:06.951 --> 00:04:11.440
find out his passwords and
be able to interview the suspect.

63
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.951
Now if we're talking about a residence,
the timing may be different.

64
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.440
If we go at the start of the workday,
family members may or may not be home.

65
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.751
We will have outside resources available.

66
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.206
If we want the suspect there,

67
00:04:31.206 --> 00:04:34.120
there's sometimes you're not
going to want the suspect there.

68
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.920
But in a lot of cases you will because
you want to try to get passwords and

69
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.540
you want to interview the suspect.

70
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.368
If there are children in the house,
the timing of the school day may be

71
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:49.370
important because you probably
do not want them there.

72
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.491
In some cases if they are the suspect,
you do want them there.

73
00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:55.761
Sometimes teenagers
commit internet crimes.

74
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.860
So you really have to consider the type of
search warrant you're serving if you're

75
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.170
serving a narcotic search warrant and
you're serving amount of residents.

76
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.140
And a lot of times digital
evidence is involved in narcotics.

77
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.544
Those search warrants are usually served
in the early morning hours because

78
00:05:15.544 --> 00:05:17.970
they are considered a high risk warrant.

79
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.440
And you generally want to get
people while they're sleeping.

80
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.400
Is that how are we going to
organize our search?

81
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.380
We can't just go in willy nilly.

82
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.750
You have to have a plan.

83
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.641
It's very important.

84
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.556
When we go in,
are we going to have team assignments and

85
00:05:33.556 --> 00:05:35.551
we're going to have room assignments?

86
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.340
We're going to label evidence.

87
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.674
We're going to make sure
we authenticate and

88
00:05:42.674 --> 00:05:48.540
organize in other words found
the evidence and where they found it.

89
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.610
And it can be organized by room
by a person that found it.

90
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.647
Or even by time it's going to depend
on how you want to organize your search

91
00:05:57.647 --> 00:05:58.261
warrant.

92
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.420
We do want to control the evidence.

93
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.766
I highly recommend you have a designated
person to record and intake

94
00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:14.140
the evidence and we are going to want
to log all evidence as it is collected.

95
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.640
What is our basis for the seizure?

96
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.719
We no longer want to go into a house and
take everything and

97
00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:26.840
we definitely don't want to go into
a business and take everything.

98
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.040
So what is our basis for our seizure?

99
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.551
Is it outright contraband?

100
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:33.440
Something that's legal to possess?

101
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.540
And we want to make sure
it's covered in the warrant.

102
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.151
So those are the two reasons you
would see something obvious.

103
00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:47.379
Contraband are covered in the warrant,
reasons why you would want

104
00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:54.040
to use restraint on nazis, items,
storage requirements may come into play.

105
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.309
If you're dealing with the business,
you're probably going to end up doing what

106
00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:02.350
we call a live collection and we'll
talk about more through out this path.

107
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.865
Talk about that more because you're not
going to be able to seize a businesses

108
00:07:07.865 --> 00:07:12.440
computers due to the effect it's
going to have on the business.

109
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.631
You're going to go into some places and

110
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:19.294
you're not going to be able to shut down
their servers because you'd be in a lot of

111
00:07:19.294 --> 00:07:22.348
trouble if the server
wouldn't come back online.

112
00:07:22.348 --> 00:07:26.969
You may be liable in that case because
there is another way to do a live

113
00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:28.340
collection.

114
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.135
And obviously you do not
seize items not covered in

115
00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:36.661
the warrant unless they
are obvious contraband evidence.

116
00:07:36.661 --> 00:07:40.320
The preservation of evidence
is of the utmost importance.

117
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.761
We need to preserve the evidence.

118
00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:47.840
That's the most important thing.

119
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.707
Evidence is defined as information or

120
00:07:50.707 --> 00:07:56.440
things introduced in court to prove or
disprove an allegation.

121
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.650
Exculpatory evidence and
this is something we want to be aware of.

122
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.020
This evidence that tends to exonerate
the accused in a criminal case.

123
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:11.240
You cannot overlook or not include
exculpatory evidence in your reports.

124
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.551
That would be an ethics problem.

125
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:20.238
Electronic evidence that is sort of
a misnomer because evidence is evidence,

126
00:08:20.238 --> 00:08:23.711
whether it's electronic or
physical evidence,

127
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:28.271
it is still considered evidence and
the same rules apply a trial.

128
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:34.099
You must remember that the evidence
first and foremost must be admissible or

129
00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:38.140
it's of no use to you and
it must be persuasive.

130
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.512
We do have some special issues with
electronic evidence because it

131
00:08:42.512 --> 00:08:45.478
can be easily altered,
created or erased and

132
00:08:45.478 --> 00:08:50.474
deleted information is an issue we have
with electronic evidence and we're

133
00:08:50.474 --> 00:08:56.940
going to talk about recovering deleted
information helped us path authentication.

134
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.465
We have to prove that the thing
is what it's supposed to be and

135
00:09:01.465 --> 00:09:08.080
that's due to the testimony of witnesses
and distinctive characteristics.

136
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.840
We have to be able to
authenticate that evidence.

137
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:16.134
You have to be able to say who found it,

138
00:09:16.134 --> 00:09:21.759
where they found it when they found it and

139
00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:27.561
show what it actually is email accounts.

140
00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:30.460
To get this content of an email account.

141
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.961
You will need a search and
seizure warrant.

142
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:40.004
You can request that the owner
of the account be delayed

143
00:09:40.004 --> 00:09:43.440
notification for up to 90 days.

144
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.520
And if you need longer than that,
you can apply for an extension for

145
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.731
an additional 90 days.

146
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:51.840
This is all done through the courts.

147
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.010
And the reason you would ask for
a delay of notification is destruction

148
00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:01.652
of evidence if the account user
finds out that you've asked for

149
00:10:01.652 --> 00:10:06.940
the contents of their email account,
they may delete it.

150
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.799
They could intimidate other
witnesses in the case and

151
00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:14.261
it could be an ongoing investigation where
you're going to need multiple warrants.

152
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.740
Record types are generally
divided into three categories.

153
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.886
We have the basic subscriber information
that's generally the building address,

154
00:10:25.886 --> 00:10:28.061
name and credit card information or

155
00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:32.540
billing information of the person
who is paying for the account.

156
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.690
We have something called
call detail records.

157
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:40.867
And these show the calls to and
from they may show

158
00:10:40.867 --> 00:10:49.020
internet log on internet log off
where the account was originated.

159
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.661
The originating IP address.

160
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.290
Those are called detailed records and
content of the account.

161
00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:01.951
The actual emails, the actual
content of that particular account.

162
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:09.240
Basic subscriber information can be
obtained through subpoenas or warrants.

163
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.298
And it will usually give you the name,
address, phone number,

164
00:11:14.298 --> 00:11:18.515
billing records,
what type of services they have and

165
00:11:18.515 --> 00:11:24.540
how long they've had this particular
service call detail records.

166
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.631
They're not content and
they're not basic subscriber information.

167
00:11:28.631 --> 00:11:33.140
They're going to give you a call history,
cell tower locations like I said,

168
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.731
they will also give you some IP addresses.

169
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:41.095
Usually if you're dealing with something
that was connected to wireless,

170
00:11:41.095 --> 00:11:45.786
you will get account creation IP and
you get uploads IP addresses,

171
00:11:45.786 --> 00:11:50.540
download IP addresses and
periodic log on addresses.

172
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.140
And this is obtained through a search and
seizure warrant.

173
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:59.940
So it's a kind of a level up from
the basic subscriber information.

174
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:05.041
Wiretaps, were talking about
wiretaps were going back to

175
00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:11.290
the Electronic Commission
Communications Privacy Act of 1986 and

176
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:17.940
this applies to wiretaps a real
time interception of communication.

177
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.441
It protects the parties
of the communication.

178
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:27.551
You would need to have some type of legal
process, court order for wiretapping.

179
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.885
If you wiretap and you don't have this
court order or if you intercept real time

180
00:12:34.885 --> 00:12:40.640
electronic communications without a court
order, you're committing a felony.

181
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.172
So just make sure you have
your legal process and

182
00:12:44.172 --> 00:12:50.340
make sure it covers this real time
interception are four steps to success.

183
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.161
We want to assemble a team.

184
00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.850
We want to have a case agent.

185
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.301
We want to have some type of
legal counsel involved in this.

186
00:12:59.301 --> 00:13:01.030
You want to talk to your prosecutors.

187
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:06.210
You want to talk to the person
that is going to be

188
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:11.130
doing the technical expertise on scene.

189
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.812
The person that's going to be
maybe previewing the computers,

190
00:13:14.812 --> 00:13:18.090
actually seizing the electronic
evidence properly.

191
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:23.563
You want to have a technical expert and
you want to have this team assembled

192
00:13:23.563 --> 00:13:28.940
well in advance of what you intend
to execute a search warrant.

193
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.936
You want to learn as much as possible
about the computer systems that you're

194
00:13:34.936 --> 00:13:41.820
going to be searching before you divide
your plan or draft your warrant okay?

195
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.661
You want to plan for the search.

196
00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.465
You want to know as much as you can
about the physical location and

197
00:13:49.465 --> 00:13:51.030
about the computers.

198
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.161
And you want to make a plan
based on that information.

199
00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.800
Then you will need to draft your
warrant or legal documentation.

200
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.340
You wore your subpoena.

201
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.870
You're going to describe
the location of the search and

202
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:10.140
you're going to describe
the property to be seized.

203
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.061
You're going to do all this accurately.

204
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.381
This concludes course for
of our computers forensics path.

205
00:14:18.381 --> 00:14:20.004
In our next course,

206
00:14:20.004 --> 00:14:25.451
course five where you're going to
cover the investigative process.
