1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.785
Welcome back to digital
forensic concepts.

2
00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:07.230
This is our final project and

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.035
these is the questions
with the answers.

4
00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:12.900
Question number 1; what are

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.580
the four phases in

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.775
a complete computer
forensic examination?

7
00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.525
The answer is
collection and storage,

8
00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:26.759
the preservation process,
analysis and testing,

9
00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.685
and reporting and testifying.

10
00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:33.335
Question number 2; what is

11
00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:37.970
the difference between
criminal and civil offenses?

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.960
Criminal law deals with
offenses against the state.

13
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.785
The burden of proof is proof
beyond a reasonable doubt,

14
00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:50.135
and its punishment can
include time in jail.

15
00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:53.300
Civil law deals with
violations of contracts,

16
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.530
lawsuits, divorces,
and custody cases.

17
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.030
Civil cases often have
a financial aspect.

18
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.635
The burden of proof is
preponderance of the evidence.

19
00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:11.495
What does the Fourth
Amendment guarantee people?

20
00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:13.205
Question 3.

21
00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:17.270
The Fourth Amendment guarantees
people it's the right

22
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.920
of the people to be secure in

23
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.795
their persons, houses, papers,

24
00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:25.475
and effects against unreasonable
searches and seizures,

25
00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:28.730
shall not be violated
and no warrants

26
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.825
shall issue but upon
probable cause,

27
00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.325
supported by oath or affirmation,

28
00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:37.835
and particularly describing
the place to be searched,

29
00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:41.215
and the person or
thing to be seized.

30
00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:44.330
So it's the right of the
people to be secure in

31
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.829
their homes against unreasonable
searches and seizures,

32
00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.450
and no warrant will be

33
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.055
issued unless there
is probable cause,

34
00:01:54.055 --> 00:01:56.850
and that probable cause has to

35
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.805
include the place to be searched,

36
00:01:59.805 --> 00:02:03.960
and the person or
thing to be seized.

37
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.410
If you violate the
Fourth Amendment,

38
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.145
that will result in the
evidence being thrown out.

39
00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:14.175
Question number 4; what is

40
00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:18.885
a consent search and can
consent be withdrawn?

41
00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:22.730
A consent search is when a
person gives permission for

42
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.685
an official to seize and
search their property.

43
00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:29.960
Consent should be
given in writing;

44
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.425
it must be given freely
and without coercion,

45
00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:37.645
and yes, consent can be
withdrawn at any time.

46
00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:42.930
Question 5; what is a
preservation request?

47
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.110
Preservation request is we
may request providers to,

48
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.240
for the time of 90 days,

49
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.790
preserve records that it has in

50
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.810
its possession pending the
issuance of legal process,

51
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.685
something like a search warrant.

52
00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:05.420
We can only ask for the
information already in

53
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.265
their possession, not
future information.

54
00:03:09.265 --> 00:03:12.175
We must have a date

55
00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:16.115
and time with an IP address
to request records,

56
00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:18.425
and we may need to

57
00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:21.535
provide an account number
or other information.

58
00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:24.710
This would be when we're
requesting records from

59
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.020
an Internet service provider

60
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.350
or some type of
social media account.

61
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.765
Question 6; what is
a search warrant?

62
00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:39.530
A search warrant is a
legal document and it

63
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.130
authorizes the search
and/or seizure of property.

64
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.575
Search warrants are issued

65
00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:48.545
upon the legal standard
of probable cause,

66
00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:51.055
and they are supported by oath.

67
00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:53.735
A search warrant authorizes

68
00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:56.915
the search of a place
to look for evidence,

69
00:03:56.915 --> 00:04:00.260
contraband, or stolen
property to be

70
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.330
used as evidence in
a criminal case.

71
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.535
Question 7; explain
the Daubert Rule.

72
00:04:08.535 --> 00:04:10.760
The Daubert Rule is a test

73
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.840
regarding the admissibility
of scientific evidence.

74
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.390
The Daubert Rule requires
that a technique used to

75
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.005
obtain evidence has been
tested and verified,

76
00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:24.065
has been subject to peer
review and publication,

77
00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:26.845
it must have a known
rate of error,

78
00:04:26.845 --> 00:04:29.430
and the method has been based

79
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.520
on accepted by the
scientific community.

80
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.800
The method that
we're using has been

81
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.080
accepted by the
scientific community.

82
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.595
Question number 8; what are

83
00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:46.850
ethics and how do they
relate to digital forensics?

84
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.020
Well, ethics are a set of

85
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.330
principles that guide
a person's behavior.

86
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.410
When we're in our profession,

87
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.645
if we make poor
ethical decisions,

88
00:04:56.645 --> 00:05:00.790
we can ruin a case
or even our careers.

89
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.820
Unethical behavior may
also severely disrupt

90
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.050
the lives or businesses of
those being investigated.

91
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.250
Unethical behavior can
lead to civil action.

92
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.890
We can be sued for
unethical behavior.

93
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.475
Question number 9; what
is Locard's Principle?

94
00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:20.930
Locard's Principle has to do with

95
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.275
the cross-transference
of evidence.

96
00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:25.060
When a person or
an object comes in

97
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.640
contact with another
person or an object,

98
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.890
evidence is exchanged
and this exchange can

99
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.370
link the perpetrator of a
crime to a particular place,

100
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.430
victim, or another
piece of evidence.

101
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.730
Locard's principle applies
to computer forensics also.

102
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.135
Electronic activities
produce artifacts.

103
00:05:46.135 --> 00:05:47.380
When we interact with a computer,

104
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.180
we produce artifacts that are

105
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.480
detectable through our digital
forensic examinations.

106
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.310
Question number 10, list

107
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.770
the stages of the
scientific method.

108
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.855
Well, we have observation

109
00:06:00.855 --> 00:06:02.715
and we're going to
make an observation.

110
00:06:02.715 --> 00:06:04.350
We're going to
develop a hypothesis

111
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.820
based on our observation.

112
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.995
We're going to test
that hypothesis

113
00:06:07.995 --> 00:06:10.515
to see if it is accurate or not,

114
00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:13.275
and then we're going to
verify the hypothesis.

115
00:06:13.275 --> 00:06:14.910
If a hypothesis is true,

116
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.620
then we make a conclusion.

117
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.770
If not, we need to form
another hypothesis.

118
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.910
Question 11, what is

119
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.150
the difference between a
witness and an expert witness?

120
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.120
A witness is a
person who provides

121
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.305
testimony under oath and is
subject to perjury laws.

122
00:06:34.305 --> 00:06:36.675
You cannot lie under
oath. That's perjury.

123
00:06:36.675 --> 00:06:40.980
A witness has a connection
to the incident,

124
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.050
or they have information about

125
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.215
the incident that's
being investigated.

126
00:06:46.215 --> 00:06:51.315
An expert witness is a witness
with expert knowledge,

127
00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:54.015
skill, or experience,
and training.

128
00:06:54.015 --> 00:06:57.915
They are considered an
expert in a specific field,

129
00:06:57.915 --> 00:07:00.025
and they are usually paid.

130
00:07:00.025 --> 00:07:01.610
They do not necessarily have

131
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.025
any connection to
the crime itself.

132
00:07:04.025 --> 00:07:05.930
They are an expert in the field

133
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.910
that is being talked about.

134
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.995
Question number 12.

135
00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:13.595
What are the three V's
of big data forensics?

136
00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:17.280
We have volume, and

137
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.325
the volume refers to the
complexity and size of the data.

138
00:07:20.325 --> 00:07:25.320
Velocity refers to the speed
that modern data travels at.

139
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.645
Variety refers to

140
00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:31.035
unstructured and/or
multi-structured data.

141
00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:35.320
Those are the three V's
of big data forensics.

142
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.045
Question 13, give examples

143
00:07:39.045 --> 00:07:41.625
of how a crime scene
can be documented.

144
00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:44.235
Well, we can document a crime
scene with photographs,

145
00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:46.455
we could document it with videos.

146
00:07:46.455 --> 00:07:50.230
We could draw diagrams to
document our crime scene.

147
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.210
Question 14, what is
digital evidence?

148
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.855
Digital evidence is anything
that can hold data,

149
00:07:57.855 --> 00:07:59.670
such as computer or a tablet,

150
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.085
a cell phone, router,
watch, camera,

151
00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:06.180
an internal, external
drive, smart TVs, devices,

152
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:11.055
refrigerators, TVs,
Nest, Echo devices, etc.

153
00:08:11.055 --> 00:08:13.230
Anything that can hold

154
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.050
data is considered
digital evidence.

155
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.400
Question 15, what facts

156
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.595
should be documented when
collecting evidence?

157
00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:27.524
Well, we wanted to document
who collected the evidence,

158
00:08:27.524 --> 00:08:30.390
where the evidence was found,

159
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.820
when was the evidence found?

160
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.485
Referring to the date and time.

161
00:08:34.485 --> 00:08:37.330
What is the evidence?

162
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.250
You want to describe it,
make model, serial number.

163
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.310
Why is the evidence being seized?

164
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.395
Is it contained in a warrant?

165
00:08:46.395 --> 00:08:51.405
Is it obviously contraband
or stolen property?

166
00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:54.105
Question 16.

167
00:08:54.105 --> 00:08:59.860
What does the preservation
of digital evidence entail?

168
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.220
Well, we want to prevent

169
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.755
destruction of the
original evidence.

170
00:09:04.755 --> 00:09:08.565
We want to make no changes
to the original evidence.

171
00:09:08.565 --> 00:09:10.980
We want to maintain
the integrity of

172
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.650
the original evidence from
the time of collection,

173
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.210
from the time we collected it

174
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.460
throughout the court proceedings.

175
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.440
Question 17.

176
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.419
If you find a device

177
00:09:21.419 --> 00:09:23.310
when you're searching
for evidence that is

178
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.465
turned off in general,
you should do what?

179
00:09:27.465 --> 00:09:31.030
The answer to that
is leave it off.

180
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.125
Question 18.

181
00:09:34.125 --> 00:09:37.050
If you find the device
that is turned on

182
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.975
in general, you should do what?

183
00:09:39.975 --> 00:09:43.200
If we find a device
that's turned on,

184
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.140
we want to photograph
all the open windows,

185
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.810
whether it be a computer
or a tablet or a phone.

186
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.490
If the device has a screen,

187
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.515
you want to photograph
all the open windows.

188
00:09:52.515 --> 00:09:56.265
We want to know any running
applications and processes.

189
00:09:56.265 --> 00:09:58.650
Any type of destructive processes

190
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.360
or any type of encryption.

191
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.180
Then we would collect the RAM.

192
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.625
The volatile memory.

193
00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:09.120
If we encounter a
destructive process,

194
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.580
we would want to immediately pull

195
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.920
the plug from the
back of the device,

196
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.470
or in the case of a
laptop or a phone,

197
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.490
remove the battery, and if you
cannot remove the battery,

198
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.340
hard shut the device.

199
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.665
Question number 19.

200
00:10:25.665 --> 00:10:30.150
When should an examiner
use write protection,

201
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.455
and part two of that,

202
00:10:31.455 --> 00:10:34.770
and why would an examiner
use write protection?

203
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.260
We're going to always use
write protection when we're

204
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.585
working with the
original evidence,

205
00:10:39.585 --> 00:10:43.605
when we're previewing
or live imaging.

206
00:10:43.605 --> 00:10:46.860
That's when we're going
to use write protection.

207
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.590
Why we would use it is forensic

208
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.810
examiners use write
protection to prevent

209
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:57.315
changes or destruction of
the original evidence.

210
00:10:57.315 --> 00:11:02.105
Question 20, what
is volatile data?

211
00:11:02.105 --> 00:11:05.995
Volatile data is data
that is eradicated,

212
00:11:05.995 --> 00:11:07.315
data that goes away,

213
00:11:07.315 --> 00:11:09.505
when the device loses power.

214
00:11:09.505 --> 00:11:12.745
Data not written to a hard drive.

215
00:11:12.745 --> 00:11:16.090
Some examples are RAM,
random access memory.

216
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.690
Some malware will
only be alive in RAM.

217
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.850
Certain registry keys,

218
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.970
running processes, and
network connection,

219
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.220
are some examples of
data that we would

220
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.270
find in RAM as volatile data.

221
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.350
Question 21.

222
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.675
What is encryption?

223
00:11:37.675 --> 00:11:41.920
What data types can
encryption be applied to?

224
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.050
Encryption is the process of

225
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.555
randomizing data,
making it unreadable.

226
00:11:46.555 --> 00:11:48.010
This is done to secure the data

227
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.140
to prevent unauthorized access.

228
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.970
Encryption can be applied to
files, containers, volumes,

229
00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:00.115
and disks. Question 22.

230
00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:05.905
What would be some reasons
to conduct live imaging?

231
00:12:05.905 --> 00:12:09.310
Well, if we find a
computer turned on,

232
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.185
and we see encryption running,

233
00:12:11.185 --> 00:12:13.930
we may want to do
some live imaging,

234
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:18.340
so we can capture an
unencrypted logical image

235
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.080
of that volume.

236
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.600
If your system cannot
be shut down you

237
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.805
might be forced to
do live imaging.

238
00:12:24.805 --> 00:12:26.425
If you're dealing with a server,

239
00:12:26.425 --> 00:12:29.485
or a network that
cannot be shut down,

240
00:12:29.485 --> 00:12:31.510
or if we're collecting RAM.

241
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:37.255
RAM has to be collected live
because if it loses power,

242
00:12:37.255 --> 00:12:38.890
the RAM goes away,

243
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.750
and then you can't collect it.

244
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.640
Question 23.

245
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.730
When and why do
forensic examiners

246
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.180
only use sterile media
for evidence collection?

247
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.765
Well, forensic examiners
only use sterile media for

248
00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:54.970
evidence collection
to ensure that

249
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.760
no previously or
pre-existing data,

250
00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.575
is on the target drive.

251
00:12:59.575 --> 00:13:02.500
We want to do this to
avoid cross-contamination.

252
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.300
Forensic examiners use

253
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.430
sterile media when
collecting evidence,

254
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.880
and when copying evidence
onto a storage device.

255
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.645
Question 24.

256
00:13:13.645 --> 00:13:15.849
Why do forensic examiners

257
00:13:15.849 --> 00:13:19.270
validate their hardware
and software tools?

258
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.670
The answer, forensic examiners

259
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.665
validate their hardware
and software tools,

260
00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:27.820
to ensure accuracy of their
findings, and conclusions.

261
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.295
We want to become aware
of any software issues.

262
00:13:31.295 --> 00:13:33.660
We want to avoid having our

263
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.640
findings being called
into question.

264
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.610
Question 25.

265
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.420
What does a full forensic image

266
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.955
of a physical disk contain?

267
00:13:45.955 --> 00:13:47.950
We're talking about from sector

268
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.230
zero to the end of the drive.

269
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.780
It is a full forensic copy,

270
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.550
commonly referred to as an image.

271
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.695
It's going to contain
allocated files,

272
00:13:56.695 --> 00:14:00.955
file slack, deleted
files, unallocated space,

273
00:14:00.955 --> 00:14:04.810
unused space, that space
prior to the volume,

274
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:10.250
an HPA, host protected
area, and a DOC.

275
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.830
Question 26.

276
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.725
What is a hash value?

277
00:14:17.725 --> 00:14:21.520
The answer, a hash value
is a way to represent

278
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.135
data with a unique
numerical value,

279
00:14:25.135 --> 00:14:28.639
using a mathematical algorithm.

280
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.835
It is like a
fingerprint of a file.

281
00:14:33.835 --> 00:14:35.620
Question 27.

282
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.195
Will the size of the data

283
00:14:37.195 --> 00:14:39.685
change the length
of the hash value?

284
00:14:39.685 --> 00:14:43.960
The answer is no. Regardless
of the size of the data,

285
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.865
the result is a fixed
length hexadecimal value.

286
00:14:48.865 --> 00:14:52.645
We have common hash
types over MD5 hash,

287
00:14:52.645 --> 00:14:54.730
which is a 128-bit value.

288
00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.645
It's always going to be a 128
bits, 32 characters long.

289
00:14:58.645 --> 00:15:03.775
Whether you're hashing
a one gigabyte folder,

290
00:15:03.775 --> 00:15:06.100
or you're hashing a
10 terabyte drive,

291
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.840
it's a 128-bit value.

292
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.990
It does not change based
on the size of the data.

293
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:15.310
We have SHA1, which is a
160 bit at 40 characters,

294
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:21.740
and SHA256, which is 256-bit
value at 64 characters.

295
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:29.590
Question 28. List some of
the common uses of hashing.

296
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.480
Why do we use hashing?

297
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.085
What can we use it for?

298
00:15:33.085 --> 00:15:35.275
Well, we can use it to ensure

299
00:15:35.275 --> 00:15:38.210
data integrity
during transmission.

300
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.510
If we know the hash value of

301
00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.460
the file that we're
supposed to be receiving,

302
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.175
once our transmission is
done we can hash that file.

303
00:15:45.175 --> 00:15:46.930
If the hash value matches,

304
00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:51.190
then we know that we've gotten
a good copy of that data.

305
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:56.170
It can also be used for sector
checking, file integrity,

306
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.834
and we use it to validate

307
00:15:57.834 --> 00:15:59.770
a forensic copies of hard drives,

308
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.990
by forensic images, to show that

309
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.770
no changes were made to
the original evidence.

310
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.425
Question Number 29.

311
00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:12.430
Describe the TCP:
Transmission Control

312
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:17.335
Protocol handshake used to
initiate data transfer.

313
00:16:17.335 --> 00:16:20.245
The device requesting
the communication

314
00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:23.410
sends a packet with
the SYN bit turned on.

315
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.960
The receiving device sends back

316
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.290
a packet with the SYN and
the ACK bit turned on.

317
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:33.130
The device requesting
the communication,

318
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.620
the first device
that originally sent

319
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.260
the SYN bit turned on
requested the communication,

320
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.890
then sends back a packet
with the ACK bit turned on,

321
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.170
and then communication starts.

322
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.440
That is the TCP handshake.

323
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.690
Question 30. What is

324
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.735
the function of DNS:
Domain Name Service?

325
00:16:52.735 --> 00:16:56.950
DNS translates our
alphanumerical web addresses or

326
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:02.000
URLs into IP addresses
and vice versa.

327
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.810
What is a MAC address?

328
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.350
A MAC address is a hardware
identification number that

329
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.515
uniquely identifies each
device on a network.

330
00:17:12.515 --> 00:17:14.730
It is burnt into
the network card of

331
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.410
the device and it is

332
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.365
unique to that device
and that device only.

333
00:17:19.365 --> 00:17:21.345
Question 32.

334
00:17:21.345 --> 00:17:25.745
What are case specific keywords?

335
00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:28.390
Case specific keywords
are keywords that

336
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.790
relate to one specific case,

337
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.785
and some examples
of this could be

338
00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:35.335
the names of the people
involved in our case,

339
00:17:35.335 --> 00:17:38.410
some usernames for those
people, addresses,

340
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.430
whether they're email or

341
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.515
physical addresses,
phone numbers,

342
00:17:41.515 --> 00:17:43.330
a certain type of
slang that maybe

343
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.519
your particular suspect uses,

344
00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:48.355
URLs that they frequently visit,

345
00:17:48.355 --> 00:17:49.960
and filenames of interest,

346
00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.700
filenames that may
be pertinent to

347
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.890
that one specific case.

348
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.970
Question 33.

349
00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.610
What would a forensic
examiner be looking

350
00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.055
for using this grep search?

351
00:18:03.055 --> 00:18:04.780
Let's take a look
at our grep search.

352
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.195
The answer is an IP address,

353
00:18:07.195 --> 00:18:09.055
but we've got grep,

354
00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:11.080
so we know we're using
grep and not extended

355
00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.510
grep. Here's our expression.

356
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.035
We have our square brackets

357
00:18:17.035 --> 00:18:18.640
with a range of
zero through nine,

358
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.770
so we're looking for a number
between zero and nine.

359
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:28.080
It's going to occur either
one or three times.

360
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.385
This is in a range.

361
00:18:29.385 --> 00:18:32.600
Either it occurs once or
it occurs three times.

362
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.535
Then we're going to see a dot,

363
00:18:36.535 --> 00:18:39.130
and then it's going to repeat

364
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.950
a numeric value of
zero through nine

365
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.410
occurring one or three
times followed by a dot,

366
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.375
numeric value of
zero through nine

367
00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:49.210
occurring one or three
times followed by a dot,

368
00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.860
a numeric value zero through

369
00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.159
nine occurring one
or three times,

370
00:18:54.159 --> 00:18:58.520
and that would describe
an IP address.

371
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.655
Because this is
grep and not egrep,

372
00:19:03.655 --> 00:19:06.565
you have to escape the brackets,

373
00:19:06.565 --> 00:19:09.590
special characters,

374
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:15.205
so that they function as
operators, special characters.

375
00:19:15.205 --> 00:19:16.510
Otherwise, it'll look for

376
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:22.070
a literal square bracket or
a literal curly bracket.

377
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.215
If this were egrep,

378
00:19:26.215 --> 00:19:29.469
we would not have to use
those escape characters,

379
00:19:29.469 --> 00:19:35.750
but we would have to use an
escape character on the dot.

380
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.455
Question 34.

381
00:19:38.455 --> 00:19:40.975
What are some of the limitations

382
00:19:40.975 --> 00:19:43.960
of a text-based keyword search?

383
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.940
Now this is plaintext,

384
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.550
you're searching for a word

385
00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.285
either in a file or you can
search your entire drive,

386
00:19:52.285 --> 00:19:54.370
but some of the things that would

387
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:59.095
impede your text-based searches
would be bit shifting,

388
00:19:59.095 --> 00:20:02.425
and this is when a file is
altered at the binary level,

389
00:20:02.425 --> 00:20:03.790
the bits are actually moved

390
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.840
around using some
type of hex editor.

391
00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.340
Encryption. Because we
know with encryption,

392
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.225
our text is not plaintext
anymore, it's scrambled.

393
00:20:16.225 --> 00:20:20.320
Compression. We would
have to decompress

394
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.640
the files and then run

395
00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.925
the keyword search
to get our hits,

396
00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:28.645
and using non-word characters.

397
00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:33.595
An example of that is
if you had a character,

398
00:20:33.595 --> 00:20:35.530
you could replace
it with a number,

399
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.940
replace an O with a zero,

400
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.860
replace an E with a three,

401
00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:43.510
and that will defeat your
plain text keyword searching.

402
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.565
Question Number 35.

403
00:20:45.565 --> 00:20:48.940
What are some of the
considerations and qualities

404
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.730
a forensic examiner must think

405
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:56.030
about to produce a
well written report?

406
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.410
Well a well-written report,

407
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.185
we must consider our
target audience.

408
00:21:02.185 --> 00:21:04.345
Who are we writing
this report for?

409
00:21:04.345 --> 00:21:06.880
Is it somebody who
is highly technical?

410
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.775
Is it our boss?

411
00:21:09.775 --> 00:21:13.525
Is it somebody who is
going to be on a jury?

412
00:21:13.525 --> 00:21:15.430
Who is our audience?

413
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.080
Who are we writing
the report for?

414
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.320
We want to make it
clear and unambiguous.

415
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.840
We want to make it detailed,

416
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.255
but we want it to be concise.

417
00:21:25.255 --> 00:21:28.840
It has to be
fact-based, unbiased,

418
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.870
and the report should include
any exculpatory findings.

419
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.330
Exculpatory findings are findings

420
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:41.660
that tend to prove
somebody's innocence.

421
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.440
End of final project.

422
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.790
Questions and answers.
