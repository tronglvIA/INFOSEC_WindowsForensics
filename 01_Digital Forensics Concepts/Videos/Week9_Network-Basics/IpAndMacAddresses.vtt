00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.105
Welcome back to digital
forensic concepts.

2
00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:05.010
In module two, we're going to

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.560
talk about IP and MAC addresses.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.580
Now in IP address and IP
stands for Internet Protocol,

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.435
can be either a V4
or a V6 address.

6
00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:22.975
A V4 address is a
set of 12 numbers,

7
00:00:22.975 --> 00:00:26.580
and it's all decimal numbers,

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.325
and it's 32 bits.

9
00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:33.110
It is going to be separated
by dots in sets of three.

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.430
We can see our example
up on the screen.

11
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.195
We have 159.181.222.133.

12
00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:45.000
That would be an example
of an IP V4 address.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.555
An IP V6 address is made up of

14
00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:53.235
eight two-byte values
separated with colons,

15
00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:57.505
be colon-separated,
and is 128 bits long.

16
00:00:57.505 --> 00:01:00.520
Now, the reason we needed IP V6

17
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.325
is because we ran out
of IP V4 addresses.

18
00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:09.580
You can see our example of
our IP V6 address down below.

19
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.580
You can see that
it has two bytes.

20
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.510
We all know that two
hexadecimal bytes are

21
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.105
represented by four characters.

22
00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:25.050
We have four digits,
or it's alphanumeric.

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.360
It could have letters and digits.

24
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.445
Each of those sets of four
is separated by a colon.

25
00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:34.455
Now, we touched on this earlier

26
00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:38.560
about traffic comes
into your router in

27
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.110
your network and then the
router routes it out to

28
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.340
the individual computers
using the IP address.

29
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.765
What the router is doing
is something called

30
00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:53.240
NAT or Network
Address Translation.

31
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.365
Now, what it does is it takes
your private IP address,

32
00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:02.365
if I want to send a message
from my computer and

33
00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:06.310
it changes it into a
public IP address and

34
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.380
then sends my message out over

35
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.560
the Internet or the
private network

36
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.990
depending on where you are.

37
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.450
It can do vice-versa.

38
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.340
If it has traffic coming in
to the public IP address,

39
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.180
it needs to translate that
to the private IP address in

40
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.500
order to know which computer on

41
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.400
the network to send
that message to.

42
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.230
The public IP address
is the one used

43
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.420
by your gateway, which
will be your router,

44
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.015
your firewall, and
all your devices

45
00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:39.500
inside the network are going to

46
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.885
have private IP addresses.

47
00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:46.450
They usually start
with a 192 or 168.

48
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.095
Now, we're going to talk about

49
00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:52.650
Domain Name Service or DNS.

50
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.490
DNS is the service that
translates your web address,

51
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.325
like say, InfoSec Institute.com,

52
00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:03.910
into an IP address.

53
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.524
It will also translate the
IP address back to the URL.

54
00:03:08.524 --> 00:03:13.030
It is a hierarchical and
decentralized system.

55
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.350
Your administrator can configure

56
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.200
what type of DNS you use.

57
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.370
There are some examples
up there on the screen,

58
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.810
we have open DNS,

59
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.725
Google DNS, and advantage DNS.

60
00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:26.000
Your network administrators will

61
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.535
configure which DNS
they're going to use.

62
00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:31.375
That stands for
Domain Name Service.

63
00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:33.710
Now, a MAC address,

64
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.240
which this would be

65
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.940
how switches route traffic
through the MAC address,

66
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.225
whereas routers use the IP.

67
00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:44.120
Our MAC address is burnt
into our network card.

68
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.370
Every single one of our
devices is going to

69
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.040
have this unique MAC address.

70
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.860
It's unique to each
device on the network.

71
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.460
The MAC address is made up of

72
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.005
six one-byte hexadecimal numbers

73
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:02.015
that are separated by colons.

74
00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:04.360
We can see an example down there.

75
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.270
This again is hexadecimal,

76
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.980
so it will be alphanumeric.

77
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.080
It's E0:15:B2:AB:FE:61.

78
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.280
This is an example
of a MAC address.

79
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.570
In our next module,

80
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.205
we're going to cover
network protocols.

81
00:04:30.205 --> 00:04:32.870
These are the protocols
and the rules that are

82
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.450
used on the network
that allows us to

83
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.090
route traffic from
our machines to

84
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.710
the internet or from

85
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.470
our machines to another
computer in our local network.
