00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.540
Welcome back to digital forensic concepts.

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.638
We're talking about network basics,
in this course and in this module,

3
00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:10.961
we're going to talk about the OSI model.

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.204
OSI stands for Open System
Interconnection.And in this slide,

5
00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:24.140
we can see the layers,
the protocols and the unit exchange.

6
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.852
The layers from top to bottom, so
from layer 7 down the layer 1.

7
00:00:28.852 --> 00:00:32.858
Layer 7, we have the application layer,
layer 6,

8
00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:37.933
we have a presentation layer,
layer 5 would be the session layer,

9
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:43.631
layer 4 would be the transport layer,
layer 3 would be the network layer,

10
00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:49.001
layer 2 would be the data link layer,
and layer 1 the physical layer.

11
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.150
And this diagram shows each layer,
each protocol,

12
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.630
and then it shows the unit exchange.

13
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.461
You look at the physical layer,
you can see the user unit exchange is bit.

14
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.201
Whereas if you look at the network layer,
you can see the unit exchange is packet.

15
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.340
So different units of exchange
happened at different layers.

16
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.130
We're going to start and
talk about layer 1 down at the bottom.

17
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.940
The physical layer is the lowest
layer of the OSI model.

18
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.440
And we are talking about actual
physical components of the network.

19
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.596
So we're talking about things
including cables, the frequencies

20
00:01:32.596 --> 00:01:37.761
that we operate are whether they
are wireless or hard wired cables.

21
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.830
This is what activates and
maintains and ends.

22
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.777
The actual physical connection is
responsible for transmission and

23
00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:55.950
reception of the unstructured raw data,
as we saw the units were bits.

24
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.830
So it is unstructured broad data
that this slayer is dealing with,

25
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.340
it also handles our voltages and
data rates.

26
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.724
How much voltage we're using?

27
00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.690
What are our data rates for transmission?

28
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.139
This is all defined in this layer.

29
00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.572
It's going to convert the digital
analog bits into an electrical or

30
00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:17.640
an optical signal to be
transported over the network.

31
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.064
Data encoding also happens at this layer,
if the data is encoded.

32
00:02:23.064 --> 00:02:28.091
Our data link layer, which is layer 2,
the main function of

33
00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:34.400
this layer is to ensure data transfer
is error free from one node to another,

34
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.926
because when our information is
transmitted across our network,

35
00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:43.502
it will have hops from
one note to another.

36
00:02:43.502 --> 00:02:48.786
This layer is also transmitting and
receiving data frames,

37
00:02:48.786 --> 00:02:53.420
and this is manages the sequence
of the data frames.

38
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.026
This layer also sends and
accepts acknowledgement for

39
00:02:57.026 --> 00:02:59.160
the frames received and sent.

40
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.070
The frame was you sent,
was the frame received?

41
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.350
If the frame was not received,
it also was responsible for re sending it.

42
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.340
This is handled at that later,

43
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.800
the data link layer.And it does manage the
frame traffic control over the network.

44
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.821
So the unit is frames, and this is
the layer that is responsible for ensuring

45
00:03:19.821 --> 00:03:25.234
that the data is transferred from one node
to another without errors, and if there

46
00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:30.280
are errors, this layer is responsible
to re send those frames of data.

47
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.267
Now, the network layer is responsible for
packets, because its unit is packets, so

48
00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:39.078
it will handle the packet forwarding,
it will handle the routing

49
00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:42.300
through different channels
from one node to another.

50
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.014
It acts as kind of the network
controller of the traffic cup, and

51
00:03:47.014 --> 00:03:50.500
also manages our subnet traffic.

52
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.131
It will decide which route to take, and

53
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:58.395
it usually does that by which route would
be the fastest.And it is what divides

54
00:03:58.395 --> 00:04:03.423
the outgoing messages into packets,
and then reassembles the messages,

55
00:04:03.423 --> 00:04:08.540
the incoming packets to be sent
up to the higher levels of the.

56
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.861
The transport layer, layer 4 handles

57
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:17.100
the coordination of data between
the system and the host.

58
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.573
It decides how much data is going to send,

59
00:04:20.573 --> 00:04:25.650
how fast it's going to send it and
where it's sending it to.

60
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.197
A good example of a protocol on
the transport layer would be the TCP,

61
00:04:31.197 --> 00:04:35.769
which is built on top of the IP or
internet protocol, and

62
00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:38.820
it is commonly referred to as TCP IP.

63
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.340
We did discuss that earlier.

64
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.820
Now the transport layer receives
messages from the session layer above.

65
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.506
It converts the message
into smaller units,

66
00:04:48.506 --> 00:04:53.140
what it does that it's going to
pass it on to the network layer.

67
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.325
The session layer which is layer 5,
is what creates the session because

68
00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:03.425
when two devices need to communicate,
a session has to be created, and

69
00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:09.561
it's done at the session layer.And this
is involved setting up the communication.

70
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.920
An example would be how long should
the system wait for response?

71
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.440
When is it going to time out?

72
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.096
The session layer handles
the coordination of communication,

73
00:05:23.096 --> 00:05:28.799
it handles transmission between the
applications at each end of the session.

74
00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:32.353
So two computers
are talking to each other,

75
00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:36.483
each one is involved in the session,
and layer 5,

76
00:05:36.483 --> 00:05:41.977
the session layer is what handles
how communication is conducted.

77
00:05:41.977 --> 00:05:44.991
It makes sure it happens properly so

78
00:05:44.991 --> 00:05:50.315
that the session does not end
prematurely and cause data loss,

79
00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:55.048
and all this is handled at
the session layer, layer 5.

80
00:05:55.048 --> 00:05:58.471
Layer 6 is called the presentation layer.

81
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.352
This layer kind of prepares the data,
just like it kind of says it presents it,

82
00:06:05.352 --> 00:06:10.289
ensures that it's set in such a way
that the receiver can understand

83
00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.275
it.The receiving device can
interpret the data, and

84
00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:20.371
this could involve languages, syntax,
it sort of plays the role of a translator.

85
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.810
It presents the data for
the application of the network.

86
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.659
One of the important things that happens
here at layer 6, is encryption and

87
00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:34.618
decryption, happens at later 6,
the presentation layer.

88
00:06:34.618 --> 00:06:39.279
The layer above layer six is going
to be the application layer, and

89
00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.525
this is the top most layer
of the OSI model, and

90
00:06:42.525 --> 00:06:47.840
this is the layer that most users
are going to interact with directly.

91
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.117
This receives information
directly from the user, and

92
00:06:51.117 --> 00:06:54.440
it displays an incoming
information to the user.

93
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.211
And good examples of things we're going
to see at the application layer are going

94
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:01.620
to be our Web browsers, Telnet and FTP.

95
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.851
And these are communications that rely
on layer 7, the application layer.
