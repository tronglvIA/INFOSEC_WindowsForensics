00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
Welcome back to digital
forensic concepts.

2
00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:05.835
In this course, course 10,

3
00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:08.520
we're going to talk
about network basics.

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.814
In overview of this course,

5
00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:13.290
we're going to define
what a network is.

6
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.425
We're going to talk about
how a network functions.

7
00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:18.750
How does the data get
across our network?

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.670
We're going to talk about IP and

9
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.740
MAC addresses and what they are,

10
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.980
and how they're used
in network protocols,

11
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.540
and how they're used throughout

12
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.735
the network to complete
transmissions of data.

13
00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:32.430
We're also going to talk about

14
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.950
Internet protocols
and the OSI model.

15
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.605
In Module 1, we're going to

16
00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:42.320
define the network and

17
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.665
we're going to talk about the
functions of the network.

18
00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:48.530
What is a computer network?

19
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.160
Well, a computer network is
defined as a collection of

20
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.170
computers linked together
for communication

21
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.465
and sharing of data
and other resources.

22
00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:59.180
You might have a network in
your home where you share

23
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.605
a printer and you could share
data between the computers.

24
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.685
If you work in a
business environment,

25
00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:06.110
you might have a larger scale

26
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.555
network that you use at work.

27
00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:12.890
A LAN, or a local area network,

28
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.250
is a group of computers linked
together in a small area,

29
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.235
generally, it's one
geographical location.

30
00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:20.930
It could be in one building or

31
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.145
a small home office,
whereas a WAN,

32
00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:26.165
a wide area network,

33
00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:28.360
is a group of computers linked

34
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.180
together over a large
geographical area.

35
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.710
This can span city,

36
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.285
states, and even countries.

37
00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:38.440
The data is transferred across

38
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.170
this network in things
called packets.

39
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.090
These packets have a header,

40
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.665
a footer, and a payload.

41
00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:52.450
The header, much
like a file header,

42
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.140
tells computers what type
of service they are,

43
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.420
are they TCP, UDP.

44
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.460
They tell us the source,

45
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.405
where these packets came
from, the destination,

46
00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:06.694
where the packets are going,

47
00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:12.500
and each packet has a
sequence number and flags.

48
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.160
Now, the footer tells

49
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.380
the receiving device
that it has reached

50
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.205
the end of the transmission.

51
00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:24.810
The footer also has error
checking and usually that's in

52
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.225
a CRC format which stands for
cyclical redundancy check.

53
00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:31.880
Of course, the payload is

54
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.840
the actual data contained
within the packet.

55
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.685
We're going to talk about
the parts of a network.

56
00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:40.670
What are the hardware parts
that make up our network?

57
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.480
Well we have routers.

58
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.675
A router is something you
would have in your house,

59
00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:47.510
and you would also have
that in a larger network.

60
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.580
Routers provide
Internet connection

61
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.515
to a local area network.

62
00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:57.150
A router operates at
layer 3 of the OSI model.

63
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.115
That is the network layer.

64
00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:04.445
We're going to cover the OSI
model in a later course.

65
00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:07.610
A router connects devices within

66
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.705
a network by forwarding
data packets between them.

67
00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:15.170
This data can be sent between
devices or to the Internet.

68
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.800
The router assigns
a local IP address

69
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.600
to the device on the network.

70
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.025
Hub. Now, a hub,

71
00:03:26.025 --> 00:03:27.794
unlike a router,

72
00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:32.110
broadcasts out to everybody
that is on that network.

73
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.895
Hubs operate at the
physical layer of

74
00:03:35.895 --> 00:03:39.495
OSI Layer 1 of a network.

75
00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:43.645
They are used to connect
multiple devices in a network.

76
00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:46.355
Now, it can have
multiple connections

77
00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:48.320
and they pass on anything they

78
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.480
receive on one connection to
all the other connections.

79
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.440
There is no filtering
by IP or MAC addresses.

80
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.800
With the router, we had
the filtering by IP,

81
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.400
but with the hub, we do not.

82
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.290
Switches are also
part of a network.

83
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.005
A switch operates at OSI layer 6,

84
00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:12.510
which is the data link layer.

85
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.515
This connects the
device to the network.

86
00:04:16.515 --> 00:04:21.460
It also does its
filtering by MAC address.

87
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.170
It uses MAC addresses to route

88
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.060
the packets to where
they need to go,

89
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.870
unlike the router which
uses the IP addresses.

90
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.345
In our next module,

91
00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:38.000
we're going to talk about IP and

92
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.340
MAC addresses, what they are.

93
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.560
We've already talked
about how they're

94
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.695
used with routers and switches,

95
00:04:45.695 --> 00:04:47.660
but we're going to talk
more about what they do,

96
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.235
the functions of them,

97
00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:52.770
and how they work
on our networks.
