00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Welcome back to the
computer forensics path,

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.895
Core 6, Module 3.

3
00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:10.690
We're going to talk about
recognizing digital evidence.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.100
Digital evidence can
best be described as

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.010
anything that is capable
of holding data.

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.940
Of course, we're talking
about computers, and tablets,

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.740
and cell phones,
but we're talking

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.990
about routers, watches, cameras,

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.360
internal and external devices,

10
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.120
smart devices like
refrigerators, televisions,

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.020
Nest, Echoes, SD cards,

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.160
thumb drives, any devices
capable of holding data.

13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.605
It may not be obvious.

14
00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:49.370
We can see up here on the
screen that we need to be

15
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.265
aware of hidden drives.

16
00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.190
You can see some
of these examples

17
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.945
of flash drives that can
be hidden in jewelry,

18
00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:01.790
things that look like keys,

19
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.025
things that look like coins,
bracelets, necklaces.

20
00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.290
We really need to be aware

21
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.650
that electronic media
storage is getting

22
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.260
smaller and smaller and thus more

23
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.700
easy to hide these devices.

24
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.505
Storage items.

25
00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:22.920
Now, these are very
small storage items.

26
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.675
This is a micro SD card
here in this picture.

27
00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:31.810
It is a terabyte in
size, a terabyte.

28
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.445
That's amazing, but scary too.

29
00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:37.310
A micro SD card,

30
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.605
I'm sure everybody
knows it's very small.

31
00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:42.410
We could overlook a
terabyte of data by

32
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.930
missing one micro SD card.

33
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.415
The other picture depicts
a SanDisk thumb drive,

34
00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:53.430
which is like a mini thumb drive.

35
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.859
This also is a very
high capacity,

36
00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.900
I believe it's 500 gigabytes.

37
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.775
That's crazy, that these devices
can be so small yet hold

38
00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:07.250
such a large amount
of data and they can

39
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.450
be very easily missed
during a search warrant.

40
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.890
You want to make
sure you look very

41
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.415
carefully when you're
searching your scene.

42
00:02:17.415 --> 00:02:20.475
Computers too are
getting smaller.

43
00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:25.625
This is a picture of what
they call the atom computer.

44
00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:30.990
It is 1.5 inches wide.

45
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.755
That's how small this thing is.

46
00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:35.915
It's really, really tiny

47
00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:41.965
yet it actually has a
quad-core processor in it.

48
00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:44.050
You can see the
specification up here.

49
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.635
It supports Windows 10 OS,

50
00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:51.175
it has an HDMI graphics card,

51
00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:54.775
it also has a micro
SD card reader,

52
00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:57.250
it has a USB 2 port,

53
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.980
it is 32 gigabytes
of flash memory.

54
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.300
It's scary to think.

55
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.630
It has wireless capabilities
and yet it's tiny.

56
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.050
It's not much bigger than a
standard size thumb drive.

57
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.120
It is a fully
functioning computer

58
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.710
capable of running Windows 10.

59
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.890
We do need to be aware that

60
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.670
these types of devices are out

61
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.650
there and be on the lookout for

62
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.620
them when we're executing
our search warrants.

63
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.870
Wireless networks.

64
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.050
You definitely want to
make sure that you've done

65
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.640
some wireless network scanning

66
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.980
prior to executing
a search warrant.

67
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.000
But while you're there,

68
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.040
you definitely want to make
sure you can account for

69
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.600
every Internet-capable device
in that home or a business.

70
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.980
You do want to scan

71
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.995
the scene for
Internet-connected devices.

72
00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:55.820
Again, we want to account
for every device that

73
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.655
is capable of connecting
to the Internet.

74
00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.890
We want to isolate these devices,

75
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.950
get them off the network
as soon as possible.

76
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.330
Now there is one exception
to this and this

77
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.615
comes into knowing what type

78
00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:13.115
of case you're investigating.

79
00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:15.514
If you're investigating
a case that involves

80
00:04:15.514 --> 00:04:18.110
a lot of Cloud storage and
you're looking at, say,

81
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.915
a residence and you want to know

82
00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:23.840
what's in their Google
Drive or your case

83
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.839
revolves around something
that is Cloud storage

84
00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:30.860
or maybe social media-based.

85
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.640
Most users,

86
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.300
their home computers will

87
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.060
auto log into a lot
of these accounts.

88
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.280
Now, make sure you're staying

89
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.335
within the scope of your warrant.

90
00:04:42.335 --> 00:04:44.360
But if your warrant does

91
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.950
cover these types
of Cloud accounts,

92
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.070
before you break that
Internet connection,

93
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.320
you do want to see if
you can collect some

94
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.690
live data from these
accounts and do

95
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.820
some live imaging and get

96
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.855
information from
these Cloud accounts.

97
00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:04.175
That's going to be
the only exception on

98
00:05:04.175 --> 00:05:06.560
isolating your devices ASAP,

99
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.645
getting devices off the network.

100
00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:10.550
Again, make sure you stay within

101
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.500
the scope of your legal process.

102
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.090
Know what you can and can't

103
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.040
do and if you have a question,

104
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.350
contact your supervisor
or prosecutor.

105
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.355
In our next module,

106
00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:24.530
we're going to talk about

107
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.810
the proper collection
of digital evidence.

108
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.760
How we're going to
collect this evidence

109
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.170
without altering it.
