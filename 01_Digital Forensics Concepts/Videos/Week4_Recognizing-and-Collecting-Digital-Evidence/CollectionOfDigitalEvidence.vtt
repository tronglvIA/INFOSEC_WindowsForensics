00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.280
Welcome back to the computer
forensics path.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.640
Course six module four.

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.561
The collection of digital evidence.

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.558
When we're talking about collecting or
seizing evidence,

5
00:00:14.558 --> 00:00:19.740
we need to document who
collected the evidence.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.240
Where was the evidence found?

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.140
When, I mean date and
time was the evidence found?

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.760
What is the evidence?

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.150
So model serial number and

10
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.778
why is this evidence being seized?

11
00:00:35.778 --> 00:00:40.579
When you intake the evidence when you're
on scene evidence officer like I said,

12
00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.309
you always want one person assigned as
the evidence person, when they take this

13
00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.930
evidence in, they need to write on a piece
of paper or type into the computer.

14
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.351
The answers to all these questions.

15
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:56.040
Who where, when what and why?

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.511
Because trust me, when this case goes to
court or you have your company hearing,

17
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:07.567
you're not going to remember
the answer to all these questions.

18
00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:11.571
And if you're in a court of law this
is called authenticating the evidence.

19
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:16.277
And we talked about that if you
can't authenticate the evidence,

20
00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:18.893
it's not going to be allowed to court.

21
00:01:18.893 --> 00:01:23.555
When we seize a computer or
any other piece of digital evidence for

22
00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:28.555
that matter, the items that are attached
to it are called sub items and

23
00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:32.287
these could be attached
external storage devices,

24
00:01:32.287 --> 00:01:36.814
they could be manuals, papers,
adapters or other hardware.

25
00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:38.431
These were all sub items.

26
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:43.527
And we're going to talk about how
you tagged these, so that we don't

27
00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:49.171
get confused later throughout this path,
Photos First, Photos First.

28
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:50.940
I can't say that enough.

29
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.882
I can't tell you how many times
I've been on a search warrant and

30
00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:58.180
people just run in and
start moving stuff around.

31
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.350
You need to have everybody have
their assignments ahead of time.

32
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.781
Make sure you put the brakes on.

33
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:07.664
If you're the case person and
take these photos,

34
00:02:07.664 --> 00:02:12.740
we need to take the photos of
evidence prior to being collected.

35
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.340
We've got to show that evidence
as it was found in its location.

36
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.340
We're going to note the location.

37
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.500
We're going to know the state
of the evidence on or off.

38
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.247
We're going to note prior damage to
the evidence and at least one person,

39
00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:31.279
possibly more depending on
the size of the area searching and

40
00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.700
how many people are searching.

41
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.561
But at least one person should be assigned
to take photos and keep a photo log.

42
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.241
This is going to become very important
when this case goes to court or

43
00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:48.521
when this hearing happens.

44
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.272
This is an example of photos taken.

45
00:02:54.272 --> 00:02:56.409
You want to take an overall photo.

46
00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.070
If you look at the photo on the right,
that would be called an overall photo.

47
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.116
Now, if you look at the photo of the left,
that's close up photo,

48
00:03:06.116 --> 00:03:12.060
you need to be able to see how these
devices all connected together.

49
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.496
We need to show how this computer connects
to these external drives, connects to this

50
00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:23.240
other computer, connects to this Camp V
switch, connects to these monitors.

51
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.261
There's yeah USB ports, USB drives.

52
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.540
So you have a lot going on in
this picture on the right.

53
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.140
And you want to be able to reassemble
that system if you had to.

54
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.684
So you want to take those overall photos
showing the pieces in relation to each

55
00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:51.228
other and you want to take the close up
photos showing the connectors in which

56
00:03:51.228 --> 00:03:55.940
port all these connections are going
into and where they're going.

57
00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.340
So take many photos,
you can never take too many photos.

58
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.551
Logging evidence.

59
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.273
I can't stress this enough.

60
00:04:08.273 --> 00:04:13.358
You're going to have one person assigned
to document evidence collection

61
00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:17.940
who found the evidence,
what they found that I mean make model and

62
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.720
serial number where they
found it when they found it.

63
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.351
Date and time and any sub items
that are attached to the device.

64
00:04:32.864 --> 00:04:37.556
You want to make sure you label the
evidence, when you label the evidence you

65
00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:42.173
should include the case of the incident
number of course the date and time,

66
00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:44.241
a short description of the item.

67
00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:47.374
But you know make model serial number and

68
00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:51.428
the name of the person who
collected the evidence for

69
00:04:51.428 --> 00:04:56.160
authentication purposes at a hearing or
in the court of law.

70
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.620
When you package the evidence, make
sure you take over all the disk drives.

71
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.705
If we're talking about a computer or
something that does have just drives, make

72
00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:11.310
sure you take over all the disk drives,
the USB ports or openings for SD cards.

73
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.850
The reason being is you don't want anybody
to be able to insert anything in these

74
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.340
drives and alter your evidence.

75
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.240
You want to use paper or
anti static bags over exposed contacts.

76
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.794
If you have exposed contacts,
say, like a USB connection,

77
00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:33.525
you want to make sure that you put
some type of anesthetic bags or

78
00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:36.761
paper over those exposed contact points.

79
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:45.130
If you use plastic,
consider moisture in exposed contacts.

80
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.337
So when you use plastic you don't
want is plastic on anything wet and

81
00:05:48.337 --> 00:05:50.821
you don't want to use plastic or
exposed contacts.

82
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:51.851
You want to use paper.

83
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.266
Take your evidence seals and
when you do this,

84
00:05:58.266 --> 00:06:04.138
initial the tape, date and
time, right the case or

85
00:06:04.138 --> 00:06:08.510
the incident number very important,

86
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.837
in our next module,
we are going to talk about how

87
00:06:13.837 --> 00:06:18.771
we transport and store digital evidence.
