00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
Welcome back to the
computer forensics path,

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.455
Course 6, Module 2.

3
00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:11.440
We're going to talk about
documenting the scene.

4
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.415
When we arrive on the scene,

5
00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:15.990
the first thing we want to

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.150
do when we're executing
a search warrant,

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.370
is we want to,

8
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.065
once entry is made,
take photographs.

9
00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:27.750
Once you make entry
and the scene is

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.825
secure because safety is first,

11
00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:34.635
we're going to take photographs.

12
00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.740
We're also going to
make a video and you

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.740
can use hand-drawn diagrams.

14
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.060
I highly recommend doing
all three of these things.

15
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.040
Couple of reasons.

16
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.270
One reason is you want to be
able to look at the scene

17
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.710
as you found it before

18
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.260
people touch things
and move them around.

19
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.215
The other reason is
you want to document

20
00:00:57.215 --> 00:01:00.260
the condition of
even the residents

21
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.410
or the business as it
was when you got there.

22
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.160
This is to protect you
so that you can show

23
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.160
that there was previously
existing damage if there was.

24
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.680
You definitely want to do
all three of those things.

25
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.310
When we document evidence,

26
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.410
we're documenting the
condition of the evidence.

27
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.855
Not only if there's
any obvious damage,

28
00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:28.530
but we're documenting
it as being on or off.

29
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.830
We're talking about electronic

30
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.850
evidence for the most part,

31
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.250
was this device on or off?

32
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.290
We're going to look for
destructive processes running,

33
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.400
and we're going to get into this

34
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.415
much more in upcoming modules.

35
00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.340
Is there anything that shows that

36
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.625
drives are being wiped or
evidence is being destroyed?

37
00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:53.670
We're also going to want to
look for signs of encryption.

38
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.450
We definitely want to

39
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.180
isolate the devices
from the network.

40
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.160
We want to control Internet
connectivity because we can

41
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.165
have devices wiped or evidence
altered over the Internet.

42
00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:11.570
Changes can be made to

43
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.925
this evidence and we
do not want that.

44
00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.189
That's why when
you're making entry,

45
00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.290
one of the first things
you want to do is secure

46
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.665
the suspects and get everybody
away from their keyboards.

47
00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:24.980
Then we want to isolate

48
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.920
the devices from the network to

49
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.130
prevent destruction of evidence.

50
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.930
We want to document our actions
always, always, always.

51
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.020
We're going to document
what we did and why we did

52
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.295
that so that when we're
questioned later,

53
00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:45.840
we have an answer for that.

54
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.145
In our next module,

55
00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:56.490
we're going to talk about
recognizing digital evidence.
