00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.395
Hello, and welcome back to
the computer forensics path,

2
00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:12.130
Course 6, recognizing and
collecting digital evidence.

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.680
In this course, we're going to

4
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.850
cover preparation and planning,

5
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.700
securing and evaluating the
scene, documenting the scene,

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.480
how we're going to
collect evidence,

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.020
how we're going to transport,

8
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.440
package, and store evidence.

9
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.305
In Course 6, Module 1,

10
00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:45.970
we are going to cover the
pre-recovery planning phase.

11
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.250
Pre-recovering planning is one of

12
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.075
the most important parts
of the investigation.

13
00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:56.870
Because if we don't seize
the evidence properly,

14
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.820
it will not be
admissible in court.

15
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.430
Pre-recovery planning is
going to include being able

16
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.895
to recognize sources
of digital evidence,

17
00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:10.535
being able to document it,

18
00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:16.085
collect it properly,
package it properly,

19
00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:17.750
be able to transport it in

20
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.000
a safe way to preserve
the evidence,

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.550
and store it in an area
where it's going to

22
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.730
be secure and safe.

23
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.400
Our planning phase,
which was our first one.

24
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.040
The first thing we want
to consider is going to

25
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.250
be what kind of case
are we investigating?

26
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.370
What is the alleged
violation or crime?

27
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.145
Is it a violation
of company policy?

28
00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.695
Is it a crime?

29
00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:47.750
We're going to want to
think about our case.

30
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.340
This is going to
lead us to believe

31
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.085
what type of evidence we're
going to be collecting.

32
00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:55.100
If you're looking for
a case that's going to

33
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.800
involve a lot of
communications or

34
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.020
a case that's going
to involve a lot of

35
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.600
mobile devices versus a
case where we're going to

36
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.200
be looking at servers and raids

37
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.000
and all kinds of large
configurations of networks.

38
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.860
What type of case
are we looking at?

39
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.350
What type of evidence are we
are going to be collecting?

40
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.835
What's at the scene?

41
00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:19.060
Is this a residence
or a business?

42
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.590
Are we going into a home or
we're going to be looking

43
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.170
for maybe a single laptop or are

44
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.690
we going to a business work
and we're going to be dealing

45
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.870
with that network and that
server-type environment?

46
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.035
What type of Internet
these people have,

47
00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:35.855
is it going to be
secure or unsecure?

48
00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.030
You want to know that in

49
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.650
advance so you would

50
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.560
want to do some
reconnaissance on the scene.

51
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.490
We'll talk more about doing

52
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.080
scene reconnaissance before we

53
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.825
execute our search warrant.

54
00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:49.200
What are the user's skills?

55
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.720
Is our user a computer
programmer or is

56
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.910
our user somebody who can
barely turn the computer on?

57
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.690
Do we know if Cloud
storage is going to be

58
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.210
part of our case, is it likely?

59
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.885
If you're dealing with a
lot of social networking

60
00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:05.209
and Cloud storage like Dropbox,

61
00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.430
if you know you're dealing
with Dropbox, Google Drive,

62
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.080
OneDrive, is Cloud storage

63
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.745
going to be part of
our investigation?

64
00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:14.755
If so, how are we
going to handle that?

65
00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:17.765
When we're planning, we have
to make considerations.

66
00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:19.760
First of all, is how
are we going to enter?

67
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.470
Is this a business
where we're just going

68
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.180
to walk in and ask to speak with

69
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.610
the manager or is

70
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.650
this a home where
we're going to have to

71
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.750
be knocking on a door
and somebody's going to

72
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.375
answer it or is this more
of a high-risk warrant?

73
00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:34.310
We're dealing with a narcotics or

74
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.250
a gang-type environment where

75
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.130
we're going to need to
make a dynamic entry,

76
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.230
maybe SWAT makes
the entry for us.

77
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.860
How are we going to contain

78
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.555
the suspects once we're inside?

79
00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:49.610
Because the first
thing we're going to

80
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.620
want to do is get the people away

81
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.360
from the computers
because we don't want

82
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.930
them destroying or
altering evidence.

83
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.020
How are we going to contain the

84
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.015
suspects when we
get to the scene?

85
00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:02.080
Are we going to have
specialized legal issues?

86
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.800
If this is a business,

87
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.660
we know we're probably not

88
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.310
going to be able to
shut their computers

89
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.750
down so live imaging is
going to be concerned.

90
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.050
What type of network
are we dealing with?

91
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.070
Is it a single laptop?

92
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.815
A bunch of mobile devices?

93
00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:21.275
Is it a server firm?

94
00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:24.570
So we need to know what
we're walking into.

95
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.530
The administrator,
if we're dealing

96
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.660
with Cloud services
or Cloud computing,

97
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.585
the administrators
may not be on-site.

98
00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:35.735
Do they contract out
their computer services

99
00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:38.285
or is the administrator
going to be on-site?

100
00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:41.275
That is another thing
we want to consider.

101
00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:44.370
Planning. If we know

102
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.264
in advancement we're
going into servers,

103
00:04:46.264 --> 00:04:49.045
do we know that they
can't be shut down?

104
00:04:49.045 --> 00:04:52.520
We need to know what type of
operating system possible,

105
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.860
are they using a standard
operating system

106
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.560
or is this a proprietary
operating system?

107
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.040
Are they on or off scene?

108
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.100
Because again, we could

109
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.200
be dealing with Cloud
computers where a lot

110
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.105
of companies now are going to

111
00:05:08.105 --> 00:05:11.305
AWS or other types
of Cloud computing.

112
00:05:11.305 --> 00:05:14.565
Where are our servers
actually going to be?

113
00:05:14.565 --> 00:05:17.850
What type of databases are
we going to be dealing with?

114
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.360
Are they standard databases?

115
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.485
Are they going to be a
proprietary database?

116
00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:26.059
These are all things that
we want to know if possible

117
00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:30.180
before we plan out
our search warrant.

118
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.320
Operations plan.

119
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.150
When you show up,

120
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.310
you just can't have

121
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.600
everybody go running in

122
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.980
and start moving
everything around.

123
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.025
There's a certain way
we have to do things so

124
00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:48.385
your best bet is to assign
personnel in advance.

125
00:05:48.385 --> 00:05:51.075
You're going to
have a supervisor,

126
00:05:51.075 --> 00:05:52.370
no matter where you work,

127
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.305
you always have one of those.

128
00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:56.990
You're going to have
people assigned to

129
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.665
do interviews and search.

130
00:05:59.665 --> 00:06:04.010
You're going to have people
assign to just evidence.

131
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.300
They're going to document log

132
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.620
all those evidence as it comes

133
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.035
in and do the evidence
intake, very important.

134
00:06:11.035 --> 00:06:12.770
You're going to
have certain people

135
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.450
that are going to be
assigned to preview

136
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.010
this evidence and we're
going to talk about

137
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.965
previewing as we go
through this path.

138
00:06:18.965 --> 00:06:21.320
You're going to have somebody

139
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.810
whose responsibility it is to

140
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.430
take photographs of the scene and

141
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.475
photographs of the
evidence as they're found.

142
00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:31.100
All these assignments
should be done at advance,

143
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.070
everybody should know their
role before they walk into

144
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.115
that residence or business

145
00:06:36.115 --> 00:06:38.570
when we are doing one of
these search warrants.

146
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.570
Search warrants surveillance,
extremely important.

147
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.850
Know the place you
will researching,

148
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.280
you want to know the
physical layout as well

149
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.315
as what we're going to be
walking into digitally.

150
00:06:49.315 --> 00:06:52.305
Is that residents or
is it a business?

151
00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:54.975
Do we want people present?

152
00:06:54.975 --> 00:06:58.535
What is the layout of this
residents or business?

153
00:06:58.535 --> 00:06:59.765
Who lives there?

154
00:06:59.765 --> 00:07:01.160
Who receives mail there?

155
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.690
Who resides there?

156
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.115
All these things are very

157
00:07:04.115 --> 00:07:06.970
important before you
execute a search warrant.

158
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.180
What kind of equipment
are we going to need?

159
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.370
Well, that's going to depend

160
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.400
on what we're
walking into but you

161
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.470
always want to try to come with

162
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.140
as much equipment as
you possibly can.

163
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.840
We're going to need toolkit,

164
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.345
we'll need bags, markers,

165
00:07:23.345 --> 00:07:24.710
evidence tape, camera,

166
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.660
large envelopes,
small envelopes too,

167
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.105
anti-static bags, Faraday bags,

168
00:07:29.105 --> 00:07:31.585
bags that will block signals,

169
00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:35.445
scissors, evidence log,

170
00:07:35.445 --> 00:07:38.480
all these things are
going to be necessary.

171
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.910
This is more equipment
we're going to need

172
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.785
to consider having, we
going to need pens,

173
00:07:42.785 --> 00:07:44.810
you're going to
need gloves because

174
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.040
the areas you're
going to be searching

175
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.825
can be contaminated.

176
00:07:47.825 --> 00:07:50.315
You will need some type
of hand sanitizer,

177
00:07:50.315 --> 00:07:52.165
we're going to need labels,

178
00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:55.415
we're going to need
sterilized target media

179
00:07:55.415 --> 00:07:57.065
to copy our data onto,

180
00:07:57.065 --> 00:07:59.630
especially if we're doing
live acquisitions and

181
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.965
we're going to talk about this

182
00:08:00.965 --> 00:08:02.845
in-depth throughout the path.

183
00:08:02.845 --> 00:08:04.530
You're going to need some type of

184
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.225
laptop to run your software from,

185
00:08:06.225 --> 00:08:07.985
you're going to need
forensic software,

186
00:08:07.985 --> 00:08:09.340
we're going to need
write blockers,

187
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.670
we're going to need cables

188
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.140
and connectors because we don't

189
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.110
know what we need to
connect to at this point.

190
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.400
Then you're going
to need some type

191
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.680
of portable batteries to

192
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.810
prevent electronic items from

193
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.820
having some type of
data loss and again,

194
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.030
we're going to cover more on
this throughout this path.

195
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.820
On-site preview.

196
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.110
The reasoning for doing

197
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.690
an on-site preview
is just going to

198
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.890
reduce the amount of
items we need to collect.

199
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.330
It's going to stop us from
collecting unnecessary items,

200
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.625
which the days of walking,

201
00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:44.240
take everything, leave and
try to examine it over.

202
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.325
Most home computers now

203
00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:49.970
have terabytes size hard
drives at the least

204
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.030
and we do not have the time to

205
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.860
examine every item that can be

206
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.130
seized in even just
the average home,

207
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.120
it's just not practical.

208
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.140
You want to reduce the
amount of items you collect,

209
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.000
you don't want to collect
unnecessary items and that's

210
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.300
one of the reasons you
do an on-site preview.

211
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.480
Another reason would be to
locate relevant evidence.

212
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.560
We want to eliminate
evidence that is irrelevant,

213
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.510
we want to be able to focus
in on relevant evidence,

214
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.660
an on-site preview
will help us do that.

215
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.000
Another reason would be it would

216
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.025
limit the interruption
of a business.

217
00:09:25.025 --> 00:09:27.975
If you're doing a
live on-site preview,

218
00:09:27.975 --> 00:09:31.790
you can limit your impact on

219
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.890
that business and that's going to

220
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.080
be very important down the line.

221
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.180
In our next module,

222
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.930
we're going to discuss
documenting the scene.
