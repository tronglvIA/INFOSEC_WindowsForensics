00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.121
Welcome back to the computer forensics
path, course six, module five.

2
00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:07.303
We're going to talk about
the transportation and

3
00:00:07.303 --> 00:00:08.728
storage of digital evidence.

4
00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:17.140
Transportation of evidence if possible, we
want to use the original packing material.

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.098
This will keep the item safe and
securely packed.

6
00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:24.816
We want to use padding if available.

7
00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:27.883
If the original packaging
is not available,

8
00:00:27.883 --> 00:00:33.138
we want to make sure we pack the item as
securely as possible to limit movement.

9
00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:38.099
You definitely want to keep digital
evidence away from extreme heat or cold.

10
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.740
Don't put it in the trunk of
your car on a summer day.

11
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.386
You want to keep it away from magnetic
sources because that can alter or

12
00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:49.203
destroy your evidence.

13
00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:53.865
Some of the things we have to consider
when we're doing transportation of

14
00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:55.205
evidence, is large items.

15
00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:59.342
If we have an item that is too large for
standard transportation,

16
00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:02.127
you're going to have to
make arrangements and

17
00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:07.184
have a plan to transport that large item,
too large to fit in a regular vehicle.

18
00:01:07.184 --> 00:01:12.786
We may have to rent or
borrow a larger vehicle.

19
00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:18.761
We may have other moving items.

20
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.709
We have to consider the weather.

21
00:01:23.288 --> 00:01:26.856
If we're putting stuff in
the back of a pickup truck,

22
00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:30.919
we want to make sure we know if
it's going to rain that day or not.

23
00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:35.493
Time restrictions,
if we borrowed or rented a vehicle,

24
00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:39.606
there are going to be some
type of time restrictions.

25
00:01:41.493 --> 00:01:46.423
And when I say other moving items,
if you're moving an extremely large item,

26
00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:50.903
you may need a dolly or some type of item,
a cart, these are all things we

27
00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:55.184
need to consider when we're making
arrangements for large items.

28
00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:02.590
Storage of evidence, you want to make
sure you store your evidence in a secure

29
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.378
location, and that secure location
needs to be access controlled.

30
00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:12.316
Whether it's a log, whether you have
a camera system or you have a key card

31
00:02:12.316 --> 00:02:17.509
entry system that is logged, you need
to make sure it's access controlled.

32
00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.789
It also needs to be climate controlled,

33
00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:23.554
because digital evidence needs to
stay at a certain temperature.

34
00:02:23.554 --> 00:02:27.725
You don't want it too hot, you don't want
it too cold, you don't want it wet or

35
00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:30.040
overly moisture there.

36
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.814
And we need to document
the chain of custody and

37
00:02:32.814 --> 00:02:36.881
I know we've mentioned it before,
but it bears mentioning again.

38
00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:41.140
You need to document every time
evidence is checked in and out.

39
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.604
You need to document who had
control over that evidence.

40
00:02:44.604 --> 00:02:49.640
We need to include date and time that
the evidence is checked in and out.

41
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.998
And we need to account for
the evidence at all times.

42
00:02:53.998 --> 00:02:57.503
You can't have a block of time where
the evidence is unaccounted for.

43
00:02:57.503 --> 00:03:01.686
We're sitting on somebody's desk,
on somebody's locker, or

44
00:03:01.686 --> 00:03:03.870
in a desk drawer, that is bad.

45
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.731
That is going to hurt you down the road.

46
00:03:09.697 --> 00:03:13.032
This concludes course six.

47
00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:16.759
In course seven,
we are going to cover the triage and

48
00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.521
preservation of digital evidence.
