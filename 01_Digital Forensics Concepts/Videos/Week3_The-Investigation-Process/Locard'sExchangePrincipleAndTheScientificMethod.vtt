00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Welcome back to the
computer forensics path,

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.380
Course 5, The
Investigative Process.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.720
Throughout this
course, we're going to

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.405
cover the investigative process.

5
00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:16.030
We're going to talk about
Locard's principle of exchange,

6
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.970
we're going to discuss
the scientific method,

7
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.530
and we're going to talk
about big data and some of

8
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.775
the concerns and issues
we face with that.

9
00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:26.930
Course 5, module 1,

10
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.105
we're going to talk
about Locard's principle

11
00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:31.625
in the scientific method.

12
00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:35.210
Locard's principle
of exchange deals

13
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.165
with the cross-transference
of evidence.

14
00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:41.900
What they're talking about
is when one object comes

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.469
in contact with a second object,

16
00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.415
traces of both objects
are left on each other.

17
00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:52.025
Picture a car accident,

18
00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:54.440
where one car bumps into

19
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.230
another car and
scrapes of paint are

20
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.865
left on the other car
from the first car.

21
00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:07.690
So they both had an exchange
of paint as they collide.

22
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.970
Locard's principle
says that every object

23
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.180
that connects with
another object,

24
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.180
makes contact with another
object, leaves a trace.

25
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.855
As digital forensic
investigators,

26
00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:27.240
we're talking about computers.

27
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.840
Whenever you do something
with a computer,

28
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.410
it does leave a trace behind.

29
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.610
These traces will help us

30
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.270
link suspects to a
particular crime,

31
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.470
victims to a place,
person, or evidence.

32
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.020
The scientific method
consists of stages.

33
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.365
The first stage in the scientific
method is observation.

34
00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.550
We want to look and see what type

35
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.765
of evidence we can obtain
from the crime scene.

36
00:02:01.765 --> 00:02:03.800
From there we're going to develop

37
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.355
a hypothesis based on
what we've observed.

38
00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:09.590
After we have our hypothesis,

39
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.535
we're going to test it
and see if it works,

40
00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:14.930
like a proof of concept.

41
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.915
Once we've done that,

42
00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:22.790
we're going to verify
if it is true,

43
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.000
and once we verify
our hypothesis,

44
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.355
we're going to make a conclusion.

45
00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:31.415
If our conclusions
don't call true,

46
00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:34.825
then we have to form
a new hypothesis.

47
00:02:34.825 --> 00:02:37.660
This is cyclical in nature.

48
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.505
Usually once we make
some observations,

49
00:02:40.505 --> 00:02:42.140
we develop a hypothesis,

50
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.915
we test it, we come
to a conclusion.

51
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:47.150
From there, we're going to
find more evidence and we're

52
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.730
going to start over and
make another observation,

53
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.710
develop a new hypothesis,

54
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.940
and continue to test that one.

55
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.425
This is a visual representation

56
00:02:57.425 --> 00:02:58.910
of the scientific process.

57
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.550
You can see over here on

58
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.030
the far left-hand
side of the screen,

59
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.925
we will start with
our observation.

60
00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:09.770
Once we make our observation,

61
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.755
we'll think of a question.

62
00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:15.920
Once we have that, we will
formulate a hypothesis,

63
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.515
and then we will test it.

64
00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:21.270
Once we test it,

65
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.485
we'll make a theory,

66
00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:28.085
come up with some type of
theory from our tests,

67
00:03:28.085 --> 00:03:30.020
and from there we'll
go ahead and make

68
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.430
some more observations and

69
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.955
continue to go round and round.

70
00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:36.410
The forensic cycle, it

71
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.150
includes the creation of
policy and procedures.

72
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.110
You should all have
written policy and

73
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.854
procedures regarding
digital evidence,

74
00:03:44.854 --> 00:03:48.740
how it's collected, how
you do your intake,

75
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.720
how it is handled, stored.

76
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.915
You also want to obtain
initial information.

77
00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:01.520
So once we've done this,

78
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.920
we're going to find out what type

79
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.615
of case are we looking at?

80
00:04:05.615 --> 00:04:08.490
What type of evidence
would we expect to find,

81
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.130
and where would we expect to find

82
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.985
that evidence within
the file system?

83
00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:16.710
Then we're going to
provide an investigation.

84
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.810
We're going to document,
you're going to

85
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.460
document the site,
the conditions,

86
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.110
and your observations,

87
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.095
you have examination
and reporting,

88
00:04:25.095 --> 00:04:28.835
and you'll have quality
control and peer review,

89
00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:30.710
where your findings
are reviewed by

90
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.290
another examiner to
see if they hold true,

91
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.195
and then the last step we'll have

92
00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:38.555
testimony and final disposition.

93
00:04:38.555 --> 00:04:41.270
This is where we would bring
our evidence into court,

94
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.430
or into a hearing,

95
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.155
or some type of

96
00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:50.195
formal procedure and testify
regarding our findings.

97
00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:52.670
You should have procedures

98
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.790
for digital evidence examination.

99
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.445
You should maintain,
keep these procedures

100
00:04:58.445 --> 00:05:01.985
up-to-date with current
standards in the field,

101
00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:05.505
and you should follow
these written procedures.

102
00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:08.240
You should have work practices to

103
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.940
prevent your contamination
of evidence.

104
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.155
You need to monitor
your procedures

105
00:05:15.155 --> 00:05:17.240
using controls and standards,

106
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.890
and you need to test and
validate these procedures.

107
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.865
We'll talk more about
this throughout the path.

108
00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:30.170
We're going to validate
our tools and software.

109
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.530
We're going to do this before
we use them on evidence.

110
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.405
We want to make sure all our
tools are working properly.

111
00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.820
We want to preserve the evidence.

112
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.600
We want to make no
changes to the evidence.

113
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.165
We want to document

114
00:05:46.165 --> 00:05:48.950
every access to the
original evidence.

115
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.659
This is called the
chain of custody,

116
00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:51.860
and we'll talk more about that

117
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.270
as we go through this path.

118
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.760
But every time somebody
touches the original evidence,

119
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.530
you need to document that.

120
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.514
You want to work from a
copy of the evidence.

121
00:06:00.514 --> 00:06:02.480
You never work on the original,

122
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.150
you always work from a copy.

123
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.695
You do want to document
the chain of custody.

124
00:06:08.695 --> 00:06:11.150
Then you want to have
your reporting and

125
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.415
documentation process.

126
00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:18.710
Witnesses. There are
different types of witnesses.

127
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.620
But basically, a witness
is defined as a person who

128
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.565
provides testimony under oath
and is subject to perjury.

129
00:06:25.565 --> 00:06:27.215
A witness is going to have

130
00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:29.375
a connection with the incident.

131
00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:31.985
He's going to have information
about the incident.

132
00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:33.245
Either he was there,

133
00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:35.495
he has some first-hand
information,

134
00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.850
he knows somebody who was there,

135
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.645
so a witness who has some
connection to the crime.

136
00:06:41.645 --> 00:06:45.005
An expert witness,
on the other hand,

137
00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:48.110
probably doesn't not have
direct connection to

138
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.944
the crime or the incident
we are investigating.

139
00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:54.650
He or she is an expert
in their field,

140
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.710
and they are usually
paid to testify.

141
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.429
In our next module,

142
00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:06.950
we're going to
discuss big data and

143
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.280
the challenges that we have
when examining big data.
