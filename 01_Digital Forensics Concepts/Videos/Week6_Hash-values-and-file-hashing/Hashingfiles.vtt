00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
Welcome back, to the
computer forensics path,

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.870
Course 12, hashing.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.610
In this module, Module 3,

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.960
we're going to talk about

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.740
hashing files and which
tools we can use to do that.

6
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.050
The hash files, the
hash files in drives,

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.000
and which are open source

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.535
and which are a commercial tool.

9
00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:25.890
These are some of the
tools we can use to

10
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.020
hash files in folders.

11
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.505
There's the Zimmerman Hasher,

12
00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:31.260
which is open source.

13
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.095
The web address is on the screen.

14
00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:36.960
There's also the Karen Hasher.

15
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.205
The web address is also
in the PowerPoint.

16
00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:43.560
Now these are only two examples.

17
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.345
There are many tools out there,

18
00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.565
that will hash files.

19
00:00:47.565 --> 00:00:51.110
Now to hash drives and files,

20
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.300
almost all of your
commercial tools

21
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.010
will hash an entire drive,

22
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.585
or individual files, or folders.

23
00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:03.529
Open source tools that
will hash drives and files

24
00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:09.310
are Autopsy and FTK
Imager from AccessData.

25
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.255
FTK Imager will also allow
us to export a hash list,

26
00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:16.900
which is a very nice feature.

27
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.465
Hashing drives and images,

28
00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:22.880
also an open source tool would be

29
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.520
HDX, or FTK Imager.

30
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.570
We're going to do a walk-through,

31
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.120
where we're going to need to use

32
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.530
the Zimmerman Hasher which
we will download as a group.

33
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.835
We're going to use our Autopsy.

34
00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:49.875
If you did not download
Autopsy, in Course 1,

35
00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:54.690
Module 4, is the download
walk-through for Autopsy.

36
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.330
We're also going
to use FTK Imager.

37
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.850
Again, that download
walk-through is

38
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.790
also in Course 1, Module 4.

39
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.750
We're going to use
our Windows 10 VMDK.

40
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.984
We're going to need
a web browser,

41
00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:11.225
because we're going to
go out and download

42
00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:15.420
the NIST software
reference library.

43
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.695
Hello, and welcome back,

44
00:02:17.695 --> 00:02:19.465
to the computer forensics path.

45
00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:21.455
In this course, Course 12,

46
00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:24.380
we've been talking about
hashing and hash values.

47
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.875
In this walk-through,
we're going to

48
00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:31.955
go ahead and use FTK
Imager to extract a file.

49
00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:33.470
Once we extract that file,

50
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.205
we're going to hash it
using the Zimmerman Hasher.

51
00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:39.510
Then we're going to go
to the NIST website,

52
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.790
and we're going to download

53
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.645
the National Software
Reference Library, the NSRL.

54
00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:46.940
We're going to go ahead
and open Autopsy,

55
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.860
and we're going to create

56
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.925
a known good hash
database from the NSRL.

57
00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:55.220
We're also going to
create a known bad,

58
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.895
using the file that
we're going to extract.

59
00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:00.015
With FTK Imager we're
going to export it,

60
00:03:00.015 --> 00:03:01.260
and then we're going to hash it

61
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.910
with this Zimmerman Hasher,

62
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.850
and that hash value
is going to be

63
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.040
our known bad hash value.

64
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.530
Let's get started. If you
haven't already done so,

65
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.410
please go ahead and
launch FTK Imager.

66
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.570
Once FTK Imager
launches, please file,

67
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.960
and then we're going to
add an evidence item.

68
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.270
Once you've done that,

69
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.205
once you've added
your evidence item,

70
00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:25.415
we're going to add
the Windows 10 VMDK.

71
00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:26.885
It's an image file.

72
00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:28.985
Next, we're going to
browse out to it,

73
00:03:28.985 --> 00:03:32.730
and we're going to pick
the Windows 10 VMDK.

74
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.130
I just click "Open"
and it will launch.

75
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.290
Once you've done that,

76
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.240
we're going to go to partition 2,

77
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.590
we're going to expand the route,

78
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.285
we're going to expand users,

79
00:03:41.285 --> 00:03:42.770
we're going to expand Ivan,

80
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.205
we're going to expand downloads,

81
00:03:45.205 --> 00:03:47.250
we're going to expand new folder,

82
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.090
and we're going to
highlight this upx394w.

83
00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.210
The file we're looking
for here is this upx.exe.

84
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.510
We're going to go ahead and
highlight that, right-click.

85
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.165
We're going to click
"Export files."

86
00:04:06.165 --> 00:04:08.480
Now you can save this
anywhere you'd like.

87
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.355
I'm going to go ahead and

88
00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:13.415
save it in my documents.
Click "Okay."

89
00:04:13.415 --> 00:04:16.959
We can see it exported
zero folders in one file,

90
00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.780
and it tells us how many bytes.

91
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.930
Once we've done that, we're
all set with FTK Imager.

92
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.070
We can go ahead and
close FTK Imager.

93
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.740
Now I want to go ahead and
open the Zimmerman Hasher.

94
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.510
Once we've opened the
Zimmerman Hasher,

95
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.820
we're going to go File,

96
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.725
and we're going to
select our file.

97
00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:33.230
We're going to navigate back out

98
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.730
to where we saved our file.

99
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.320
I know it was in documents,

100
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.700
and I selected the upx.exe.

101
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.870
I'm going to click
"Open." You can see,

102
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.710
we're immediately presented with

103
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.720
the SHA-132 base and the MD5
hash value of this file.

104
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.220
Now we can go ahead and
under Tools, Options,

105
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.030
you see you can select
different types of hash values.

106
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.365
We could do the SHA-16,
the MD4, SHA-256, SHA-512.

107
00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:06.200
But we're going to go
ahead and we're going

108
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.335
to copy these values.

109
00:05:08.335 --> 00:05:10.770
We're going to copy the MD5 and

110
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.420
the SHA-1 hash values out
to a notepad document.

111
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.695
We're going to go to File,

112
00:05:16.695 --> 00:05:19.050
Save results, To text.

113
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.910
Then it's going to ask you
where you want to save them.

114
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.399
Then you can go ahead and
save them wherever you like.

115
00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:28.940
I am going to go ahead and
put mine in documents again.

116
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.140
I'm going to click "Okay."

117
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.795
Results have been
saved successfully,

118
00:05:32.795 --> 00:05:34.745
and it names them with the date,

119
00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:37.945
and it just names them
as HashResults.txt.

120
00:05:37.945 --> 00:05:39.530
I'm going to go ahead
and navigate out

121
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.470
to that file, HashResults.txt.

122
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.030
We can see it right
here with the date.

123
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.240
Double-click on it, to open it.

124
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.630
You can see, it
gives you the path,

125
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.620
and it's giving you your
SHA-1 and MD5 hashes.

126
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.175
It saves it out in a file for us.

127
00:05:55.175 --> 00:05:57.935
This is the SHA-1 hash
value right here,

128
00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:00.660
and this is the MD5 hash value.

129
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.600
We can go ahead and close
hasher at this point.

130
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.235
Now, let's navigate out to
the NIST software library.

131
00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:09.875
Once we're here, you can see it

132
00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:12.630
explains what NIST
is, and what it does.

133
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.785
We want to go to
the NSRL downloads.

134
00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:18.525
We want the current hash sets.

135
00:06:18.525 --> 00:06:21.695
We want the modern RDS minimal.

136
00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:23.170
We can go ahead and save that.

137
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.410
I'm going to save
that in my downloads.

138
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.210
It's going to download.

139
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.280
Once it downloads,
I'm going to use

140
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.410
7-Zip to extract that.

141
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.110
There are several
different hash sets here.

142
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.320
The full download,
comes in an ISO file.

143
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.780
It's going to be
between 500 megabytes

144
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.210
to almost four gigabytes in size.

145
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.270
It will take a long
time to download.

146
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.935
You don't really need that.

147
00:06:46.935 --> 00:06:49.230
But if you want to
download that on your own,

148
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.295
you can do that.

149
00:06:50.295 --> 00:06:52.350
For the sake of this course,

150
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.225
we are going to just
use the minimal.

151
00:06:54.225 --> 00:06:56.760
There is also the RDS.
Then there's unique.

152
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.100
They also have ones
for Android, iOS,

153
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.080
and legacy computers, older
computers, 1999 and earlier.

154
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.810
This is all the standard type of

155
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.425
software that you would find,

156
00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:09.515
on the computer part of the
operating system files,

157
00:07:09.515 --> 00:07:13.575
regular program files, known
Microsoft Office products.

158
00:07:13.575 --> 00:07:15.660
These are all known files.

159
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.925
It's a National Software
Reference library.

160
00:07:17.925 --> 00:07:20.175
Once you've done that,
go ahead and extract it.

161
00:07:20.175 --> 00:07:22.925
Again, all I did was
right-click "7-Zip,"

162
00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:24.810
"Extract files," choose wherever

163
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.305
you want to extract them to,

164
00:07:26.305 --> 00:07:29.895
and then go ahead and click
"Okay." They're extracting.

165
00:07:29.895 --> 00:07:31.650
It'll take them a
couple minutes because

166
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.285
it is a large file.

167
00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:36.600
While that's running, go
ahead and launch Autopsy.

168
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.820
Once you've launched Autopsy,

169
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.500
if you haven't done so,

170
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.020
create a new case.

171
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.520
How we would do that is we
would go to Case, New case.

172
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.515
You can name the case
anything you want.

173
00:07:49.515 --> 00:07:50.910
I think we may already have

174
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.530
the case in here named hacking.

175
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.270
But I'll walk you through this.

176
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.800
I'm going to call this, and

177
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.210
I know I already
have one of these,

178
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.375
so I'm just going to call _12.

179
00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:01.170
But you can name it
whatever you'd like.

180
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.970
I have it in single user.

181
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.610
Then you'd click "Next."

182
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.230
You give the case a number.

183
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.265
Any number you want is fine.

184
00:08:08.265 --> 00:08:10.025
You could put, usually, the year,

185
00:08:10.025 --> 00:08:12.475
and then the number
that the case is.

186
00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:14.940
You can fill out your
name, your phone number,

187
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.490
email, and it takes some
notes if you'd like.

188
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.875
Once you fill that out the
way you like it hit "Finish."

189
00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:22.365
It will go ahead and
create the case.

190
00:08:22.365 --> 00:08:25.325
Now we're going to add our
disk image or VM file.

191
00:08:25.325 --> 00:08:27.995
I'm going to add
the Windows 10 VM.

192
00:08:27.995 --> 00:08:29.470
You navigate to where you have

193
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.360
the Windows 10 VM saved,
and click "Open."

194
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.095
You can set the time zone.

195
00:08:34.095 --> 00:08:36.260
This is the time zone I am in.

196
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.535
I will find out what time zone
the suspect computer's in.

197
00:08:39.535 --> 00:08:41.810
Or you could set it to
use TC if you'd like.

198
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.915
You can see all the different
times that we have here.

199
00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:49.150
I'm going to leave mine
at American Chicago.

200
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.115
The sector size, I'm going to
leave that as auto detect.

201
00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:54.245
If you knew the hash values,

202
00:08:54.245 --> 00:08:56.340
if you had hashed the
image beforehand,

203
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.125
you could enter those also.

204
00:08:58.125 --> 00:09:00.195
Now next, you hit
the "Next" button.

205
00:09:00.195 --> 00:09:03.035
Then hash lookup,
will run on mine.

206
00:09:03.035 --> 00:09:07.180
We have not installed
hash lookup yet,

207
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.515
so it will not run on yours.

208
00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:11.885
Just check the recent
activities box.

209
00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.810
Go ahead and uncheck
everything else.

210
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.810
Let's just do "Deselect All."

211
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.325
We're just going
to go with recent

212
00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.510
activities that should do it.

213
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.330
We'll just leave it
at recent activities.

214
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.490
Go in Embedded File Extractor to,

215
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.195
an Extension Mismatch Detector,
File Type Identification.

216
00:09:29.195 --> 00:09:30.930
Just these three, in

217
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.190
recent activity click
"Next." It will run.

218
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.580
Once it's completed running,

219
00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.310
we're going to go ahead
now and we're going to

220
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.310
install our hash database.

221
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.500
We're going to go to Tools,

222
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.780
we're going to go to Options.

223
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.770
Here we're going to
select Hash Sets.

224
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.905
You can see I already
have some installed,

225
00:09:46.905 --> 00:09:48.390
but I'm going to go
ahead and create a

226
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.595
new Hash Set local.

227
00:09:50.595 --> 00:09:53.675
I'm going to call the
hash set, known good.

228
00:09:53.675 --> 00:09:55.825
It should take you right
to your hash databases,

229
00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:57.540
and you're going to
save the known good.

230
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.940
I'm going to say known,

231
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.360
and we're going to click "Okay."

232
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.655
Now here I'm going to
import a hash set.

233
00:10:02.655 --> 00:10:04.780
Now I'm going to
navigate out to where

234
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.805
I downloaded the NSRL.

235
00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:13.230
I'm going to select
the NSRL File.txt.

236
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.780
I'm going to click "Open."

237
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.410
You can see it automatically

238
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.520
changes to known NSRL or other.

239
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.355
I'm going to click "Okay."

240
00:10:20.355 --> 00:10:22.930
It's telling me I already
have it loaded in there,

241
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.340
so I can't load it again,

242
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.920
but you should be
able to load that.

243
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.925
Now, I'm going to
create a known bad.

244
00:10:28.925 --> 00:10:32.800
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to go New Hash Set.

245
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.215
I'm going to name it packers2.

246
00:10:35.215 --> 00:10:37.230
You can name it,
whatever you like.

247
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.570
You can just name it packers.

248
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.075
[inaudible].

249
00:10:40.075 --> 00:10:41.720
I'm just going to
give it the default

250
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.510
here, save it there.

251
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.975
It automatically goes
to notable. Say "Okay."

252
00:10:46.975 --> 00:10:48.745
Now what I want to
do is I want to

253
00:10:48.745 --> 00:10:51.230
add hashes to this hash set.

254
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.800
I'm going to click that button.
I'll show you that again.

255
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.080
With the packers2 highlighted,

256
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.380
I'm going to add hashes
to this hash set.

257
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.130
Now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to

258
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.175
use my text document,

259
00:11:02.175 --> 00:11:03.605
that we had before,

260
00:11:03.605 --> 00:11:07.240
and I'm going to go ahead
and put the hash value,

261
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.750
the MD5 hash value,

262
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.270
copy that, and paste it here.

263
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.855
I'm going to say "Okay."

264
00:11:12.855 --> 00:11:15.755
It said one hash,
successfully added.

265
00:11:15.755 --> 00:11:19.620
Now we just click "Apply,"
"Okay." We're all set.

266
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.395
Now, what we're going to do,

267
00:11:21.395 --> 00:11:24.675
is we're going to run
an ingest module.

268
00:11:24.675 --> 00:11:27.605
Again, Tools, Run Ingest Module.

269
00:11:27.605 --> 00:11:30.680
We're running it on
this image file.

270
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.830
Now, I am just going to
uncheck everything else.

271
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.625
I'll go and deselect all.

272
00:11:35.625 --> 00:11:37.705
I'm going to go at Hash Lookup.

273
00:11:37.705 --> 00:11:39.305
It's going to check all of

274
00:11:39.305 --> 00:11:41.540
these hash sets that I
have loaded in here.

275
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.105
You should just have the two,

276
00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:45.200
the known good and the packers.

277
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.595
I'm going to click "Finish."

278
00:11:46.595 --> 00:11:48.270
As it's running, you can see,

279
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.695
it's running down here,

280
00:11:49.695 --> 00:11:51.030
and it's going to
give you all kinds of

281
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.520
messages as it's going.

282
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.170
It will take a
little while to run.

283
00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.210
Once it's finished running,

284
00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.790
I'm going to go ahead and take
a look at my Results tab.

285
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.430
I'm going to take a
look at hash hits.

286
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.605
I can see I have hash
hits for packers2.

287
00:12:04.605 --> 00:12:06.140
Let's take a better look at here.

288
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.790
Packers2, it shows the
one I just created,

289
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.525
shows me these two hash hits.

290
00:12:11.525 --> 00:12:15.545
Again, it's that upx.exe
that's hitting on.

291
00:12:15.545 --> 00:12:17.085
We can see the file.

292
00:12:17.085 --> 00:12:20.880
That is actually a known
bad file, that's a packer.

293
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.140
That is how we would use

294
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.975
the hash value to
find a bad file.

295
00:12:26.975 --> 00:12:28.995
You could also go through,

296
00:12:28.995 --> 00:12:31.250
and hash all the
files in the case,

297
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:36.850
and exclude the known good
files, and of walk-through.
