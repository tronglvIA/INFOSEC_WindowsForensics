00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
Welcome back, to the
computer forensics path.

2
00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:06.795
In this course, Course 12,

3
00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:09.120
we're talking about hashing.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.280
In this module, Module 2,

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.890
we're going to talk about
creating hash sets.

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.735
Why are we create hash sets,

7
00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:18.090
and what we can use them for.

8
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.565
The NIST hash set.

9
00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:26.325
NIST is a database or
a list of hash values.

10
00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:31.300
These hash values
are for known files.

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.435
They're use for eliminating
known files from our case,

12
00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.220
like Windows system files or

13
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.060
common files that come with
your install of Windows 10.

14
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.460
They could be used for
identifying files of interests,

15
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.770
files that we want to look at.

16
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.144
Suppose we were looking
for a specific document,

17
00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:54.815
may be in an IP theft case,

18
00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:56.760
intellectual property theft case.

19
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.015
If we knew the file hash value

20
00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:01.145
of the document we
were looking for,

21
00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:05.095
we might search for it on
our suspect's computer.

22
00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:07.385
It also helps us

23
00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:10.715
identify the same files
in different cases.

24
00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:13.255
This could be true with malware.

25
00:01:13.255 --> 00:01:17.325
If we know the
value of a malware,

26
00:01:17.325 --> 00:01:20.255
we could use that
hash value to find

27
00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:23.980
that specific malware on
more than one computer.

28
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.850
It also helps us de-duplicate or

29
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.685
find duplicates in our cases.

30
00:01:29.685 --> 00:01:32.640
We can eliminate the
duplicate files,

31
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.000
and cut down our exam time.

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.145
Now, the NIST hash set,

33
00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:40.275
these are known files.

34
00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:43.470
They are like system files.

35
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.205
We can exclude authentic
or genuine system files,

36
00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:52.160
known software files,

37
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.660
known as negative
hashing or de-NISTing.

38
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.225
There are several types of
hash sets available online.

39
00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:03.620
The National Institute of

40
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.260
Standards and
Technology, or NIST,

41
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.810
for short, has a website you can

42
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.670
go to download this
software reference library.

43
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.805
It's called the
NIST NSRL library,

44
00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:21.720
National Software
Reference library.

45
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.060
What do we use the hash sets for?

46
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.170
We've already talked about
finding files of interests.

47
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.950
Some cases, the example
I gave was in IP theft.

48
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.710
But we could also use this for

49
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.910
illicit images or detecting
child pornography.

50
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.565
We can search for any known file,

51
00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:43.420
using its hash value.

52
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.065
We can create our own
hash sets of files that

53
00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.760
we are either interested in or we

54
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.240
want to eliminate from our view.

55
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.190
Most software will allow us
to create custom hash sets,

56
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.770
and we're going to get to do that

57
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.245
in our walkthrough at autopsy.

58
00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:06.080
We can import hash sets
from one format to another,

59
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.255
but we might have
to convert them.

60
00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:12.275
This does have a conversion
tool on its website,

61
00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.880
which we will also download.

62
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.555
In our next module,

63
00:03:18.555 --> 00:03:23.310
we're going to talk about
hashing individual files.
